## **What are these features?**

### **Mobile App Promotion Tool:  **

This feature streamlines the process of promoting mobile apps to your sub-accounts. Choose between Highlevel, LeadConnector, or a Whitelabel app, and with a simple click; you can make their download links available to your sub-accounts. This tool is designed to efficiently and hassle-free distribute apps to different users, whether clients or partner companies.

#### **Usage Cases:**

**Enhancing Client Engagement:  **Consider an agency named "Digital Pioneers." They use the mobile app promotion tool to share their customized Whitelabel app with their clients. Now, clients can directly access their marketing campaigns, monitor progress, provide feedback, and schedule meetings with the agency from their mobile devices. This convenience fosters transparency and increases client engagement, resulting in a higher retention rate for Digital Pioneers.

**Simplifying Remote Team Management:** Imagine an agency called "Marketing Mavericks," which has a distributed team across different time zones. Promoting the Highlevel Mobile app or LeadConnector to their team members ensures everyone can view their tasks, update their progress, and communicate with clients without being tied to their desks. This makes remote work management a breeze for Marketing Mavericks and boosts their team's productivity.

**Consistent Branding across Franchisees:** Suppose "Brand Masters" is a successful marketing agency that has franchised its operations in various cities. They use the Whitelabel mobile app customizer to create an app that reflects their brand's identity and promotes it across all franchisees. This ensures a consistent branding experience for all clients, regardless of the branch they work with, enhancing the overall reputation of Brand Masters.

**Providing Added Value to Clients:** An agency named "Growth Gurus" wants to stand out in the highly competitive marketing industry. They customize the Whitelabel mobile app and promote it to their clients as an additional service, allowing them to manage their campaigns on the go. This unique offering differentiates Growth Gurus from other agencies, attracting more clients.

**Streamlining New Branch Integration:** A rapidly expanding agency, "Rapid Raptors," opens a new branch in a different region. They promote their Whitelabel mobile app to new team members, allowing them to understand the agency's processes and workflows quickly. This speeds up the integration process of the new branch and keeps their operations running smoothly.

### **Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer:  **

This feature offers the flexibility to personalize your mobile app per your brand identity. You create a mobile app that reflects your brand's aesthetics by uploading your logo and splash screen image, selecting a color scheme and fonts, and arranging menu items. Furthermore, providing necessary details like your agency name, contact information, and app description gives your app a professional and complete finish.

After customizing, you can preview the app and submit it for review. Once it receives approval and goes live, your uniquely branded app is ready to be shared with your audience.

By leveraging these features, you can effectively reach a wider audience with a mobile app that aligns seamlessly with your branding guidelines, enhancing your brand's visibility and consistency across platforms.

#### **Usage cases:**

**Agency B - Client-Specific Branding:  **This agency provides tailored marketing solutions for each client. They go one step further by creating individual mobile apps with the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer that are fully branded per each client's visual identity. They design each app to visually align with the respective client's website, social media platforms, and other marketing materials. This delights their clients and provides the end-users (the client's customers) with a familiar and consistent experience.

**Agency C - Training App with Branding:** Agency C, known for its regular training programs, uses the Whitelabel Mobile App Customizer to create a branded training app. They incorporate their unique design elements into the app's user interface, ensuring that even the training platform reflects their brand. This enhances the learners' experience and cements the agency's branding in their minds.
