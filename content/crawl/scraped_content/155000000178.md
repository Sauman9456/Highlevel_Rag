# Enabling Cross-Site Tracking (3rd Party Cookies)

Modified on: Thu, 15 Jun, 2023 at 8:07 AM

# Safari on MacOS

  1. **Launch Safari**

Open Safari by clicking on the Safari icon located in the dock or by searching for "Safari" using Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and selecting the application.

  2. **Access Safari Preferences**

In the top menu, click on "Safari" and then select "Preferences" or "Settings" from the drop-down menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut (Cmd + comma) to directly access the Preferences window.

  3. **Open the Privacy Tab**

Once the Preferences window appears, click on the "Privacy" tab at the top.  

  4. **Customize Website Tracking Options**

In the Privacy tab, you'll see various options related to website tracking. By default, Safari blocks cross-site tracking. To enable it, uncheck the box next to "Prevent cross-site tracking."  

  5. **Close Preferences**

After adjusting the desired settings, close the Preferences window.
