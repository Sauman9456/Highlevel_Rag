# SMS is coming from a different Twilio number than the one in Phone Numbers tab

Modified on: Tue, 25 Jul, 2023 at 6:55 PM

Issue:

There's confusion regarding sending text messages in Mexico, as the recipient sees a different number than the one you sent it from. This happens due to a specific regulation in Mexico for mobile text messages.

In Mexico, AT&T is the only mobile company that allows texts to be sent from a regular phone number. These messages are primarily intended for person-to-person, or P2P, conversations. According to the rules, if more than nine texts are sent from the same number in less than two minutes, the system automatically changes the **'Sender ID'** \- the number from which the message appears to be sent. This is done to comply with Mexico's regulations.

Therefore, if your messages are appearing from a different number, it's due to this regulation being applied. To avoid this, please vote [here](https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/search?search=shortcode) so we can support shortcode.
