The Multi-Branch Feature enables the creation of branches that can dynamically adjust based on various predefined conditions. By allowing multiple branches within a workflow each contact can directed down the appropriate path based on their interactions or status.

  * **Branch Section:** Defines the name or identifier for the specific branch section.
  * **Branch Section Description:** Provides a brief description or details about the branch section.
  * **Branch Name Label:  **Specifies the label that will be displayed for the branch name.
  * **Branch Name Helptext:  **Offers additional information related to the branch name.
  * **Delete Branch Title:  **Sets the title or label used when deleting a branch.
  * **Delete Branch Description:** Describes when a branch is deleted.

  * **Allow New Branches:  **Enables users to add new branches within the action.

  * **Is Predefined Branches Editable** : Allows users to edit predefined branches within the action.

  * **Show Branches Section:  **Displays the branch section details to the user.

**Disabled Allow new branch  
**

**Pre-defined branch is editable**

**Hide branch**

**Sample payload for branches**

    {
      "data": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": "29",
        "gender": "male",
        "hobbies": [
          "sports",

        ]
      },
      "extras": {
        "locationId": "xyz",

            "version": "1.0",
       }

### **Custom code  **

Custom Code allows users to create custom logic they want to achieve. This provides flexibility and control beyond the pre-built APIs, enabling users to automate complex tasks and integrate with various services not supported by API.

**Code Editor**

You can write the code in the Code Editor

You can input HTTP requests like Get, Put, Post, Delete etc via the button.

You can also use cutom values using the picker.

Output should be a JavaScript Object or Array of Objects.

## **Test and format your Code**

  * Testing the code is a mandatory step, if the test is not done then user will not be able to use the output of the code in the subsequent steps.
  * To test the code click on the "Test Code" button.
  * Post clicking on Run test button, if there are no errors in the code them it will show "Test Result Success" and if there is an error in code then the result will be "Test Result Failed" and you would have to recheck the code to remove the error.
  * You can also format the code using "Format code" button.

##   

##   

## Pause Execution

  * This toggle is used the contact will be held at this action unless resume webhook is requested.
  * If this toggle is true then provided extras object needs to be pass as body payload for resume workflow endpoint.
  * Show API details button shows a sample response to be passed onto to the webhook for Success Execution and Failed Execution.

I**n case of Sync Execution**

When the pause execution is turned off along with branching support, the contact will be moved to provided branch using `branchId` property from API response or from Custom Code using return statement. The branchId here will be the branch through with the contact will move forward.

**In case of Async Execution**

When the pause execution is turned off, the branch ID needs to be sent to the webhook for resuming which is present in "show API details" button. More info present in Pause functionality.

## **Response Data**

Add sample response data to configure custom variables.

**Add sample response**

Enter a valid sample response JSON structure that will be sent as a response to the Send Data API endpoint.

Arrays are supported in response data. This data can be utilized in custom variables based on references and is available for use in Array Functions, Custom Code, and Custom Webhooks.

## 

## 

A new dropdown option allows users to select between a standard value or a custom value picker.

  * Standard Values: Users can input data based on the field type (e.g., date, dropdown, tag).
  * Custom Value Picker: Users can input data from custom fields, such as values from an inbound webhook trigger or other custom fields.

## **Manage Custom Variables**

Add Custom variables using sample response data, for users to use in workflows

## 

##   

## **Add Custom Variable**
