### **What makes it a good payment collection option?**

1\. **Seamless Transactions** \- Completing transactions via POS has never been smoother with **_Tap to Pay_**. It works with compatible contactless payment options.

[](https://www.authorize.net/)2\. **Speed and Convenience** \- Tap your customers' compatible card or smartphone using the App, and you're done! No swiping, no PINS, and no signatures. It's that easy!

3\. **Enhanced Security** \- Rest assured, your and your customers' financial information is always protected. Tap to Pay uses cutting-edge encryption technology to safeguard your transactions. 

4\. **Wide Compatibility** \- Whether your customers prefer using contactless credit cards or mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay or Google Pay, Tap to Pay supports them all. 

### **How to Use Tap to Pay**

  * On the Mobile App, choose _**Point of Sale**_.

  * [](https://www.authorize.net/)Enter the amount for the transaction and put in some details about the sale by clicking on _**+Note**_. 

****

**Please Note** :

    Make sure that your Stripe account is connected/integrated on the Web app prior to accessing Tap 2 Pay on the mobile app. If you see a message saying "Stripe not connected" then that means you need to integrate it on the web app first.

You can integrate your Stripe account by going to **Payments  **> **Integrations** > **Connect with Stripe**

  * Ensure the location on the mobile app is configured correctly, as Tap 2 Pay only works for specific locations (Currently US only). 

  * Once everything has been configured and set, you can now use Tap 2 Pay. After putting in the amount and note, click on **_Charge (Amount)_**

  * Wait for it to load and connect to the reader.

  * Add a tip on top of the amount if necessary. You can also customize the amount for the tip by clicking "Custom." If not, then just proceed with "No tip."

  * Ask your customer to tap their contactless payment method (e.g., Credit card, Apple Pay, etc.) to the App for the app to collect the payment to your Stripe account.

  * Once it goes through, you'll see "Approved, Payment Successful" on the screen, the name of the business and also a transaction ID.

### **Supported Devices**

1\. All Android devices (with NFC capability) running on Android 8 OS or later.

2\. For iPhone Users:

  * An iPhone XS or later running on iOS 16 or later (US)

**Please Note** :

    Tap to Pay won't work on the Beta releases of iOS. We also highly recommend to update to the latest OS for the best experience.
