## **Submit for Review**

The trigger version will be in draft state by default. After updating the trigger information and configuration the trigger version should be submitted for review.

Once approved the version submitted for review will be published live to all Sub-accounts.

##   

## **Create New Version**

Click on  **\+ New Version** to create a new version for the trigger

On clicking **\+ New Version** It will create a new draft version with all the previously published data prefilled.

##   

## **Delete Trigger**

Once a Trigger is deleted, it will be deleted permanently and cannot be restored. The deleted trigger will be removed from Marketplace App and Workflow Trigger list. If a deleted trigger is part of any workflow the trigger execution will be skipped.

**Enter trigger name to confirm delete**

## **Can workflow execute without contact?**

  * Workflow can run contactless without any Contact data dependency so you can send any payload data via Marketplace Triggers and use it in workflow.
  * You can proceed without contact and use actions that are not dependent on contact information. Custom Webhook, Google Sheet, Slack, ChatGPT and all Internal Tools can be executed without contact.
  * If necessary, you can use the Create/Update or Find Contact actions to retrieve the contact data to the workflow.  
  
**Example:**
  * Send order data to trigger and add the order information to google sheet, use if/else to categorize based on order value and send a slack notification.
  * Retrieve the contact with Contact ID using Find contact action
