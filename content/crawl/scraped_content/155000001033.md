# How to Invite Members to Your Group via Email

Modified on: Sun, 22 Oct, 2023 at 10:11 AM

This guide is intended for Admins and Owners who want to invite individuals to their Group using the email invitation feature. This feature streamlines the process of inviting people to your Group via email, facilitating better collaboration within your group.

# **Inviting People via Email**

**Step 1: Access the 'People' Tab**

  * Log in to your account as an Admin or Owner.  

  * Navigate to the 'People' tab within your Group's settings.

**Step 2: Initiate the Invitation Process**

  * Locate the 'Invite Member' button, typically found within the 'People' tab.

**Step 3: Enter Invitation Details**

  * Click the 'Invite' button to initiate the invitation process.  

  * You will be prompted to provide the name and email address of the person you wish to invite.

**Step 4: Grant Admin Privileges (Optional)**

  * As an Admin, you have the flexibility to grant admin privileges to the invited member. This will bestow enhanced control and access within the Group.

**Step 5: Send the Invitation**

  * After entering the necessary information, click the 'Invite' button to send the invitation.

# **Invitation Flow**

Once the invitation is dispatched, the recipient will receive an email with the following behavior:

**Scenario A: User Has Never Signed Up or Is Not Part of the Client Portal**

  * If the recipient has never signed up for the platform or is not part of the client portal, they will find an "Accept Invite" button in the email.  

  * Clicking this button will redirect them to a "Set Password" modal where they can create their account.

**Scenario B: User Is Already a Member with Login Credentials**

  * If the recipient is already a member with login credentials, clicking the "Accept Invite" button will instantly redirect them to the Group using a magic link.

**Important Note:**

The invitation link included in the email will expire after 30 days for security reasons. Ensure that the recipient accepts the invitation within this timeframe.
