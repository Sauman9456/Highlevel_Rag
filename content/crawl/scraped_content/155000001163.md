# Managing Marketplace App Permissions: White Label Agency Control

Modified on: Thu, 19 Oct, 2023 at 4:36 AM

This article offers step-by-step instructions for white label agencies on how to manage the visibility and installation of marketplace apps for their sub-accounts. This feature allows agencies to have granular control over which apps are available to their sub-account customers.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * Locating the App Permissions Management:
  * Approving Apps:
  * Disapproving Apps:
  * Bulk Approve/Disapprove Marketplace Apps:

##   
**Locating the App Permissions Management:**

  * Click on 'App Marketplace' on the left menu.
  * Note: If 'App marketplace' is not visible on your agency account, you can enable it from the labs.
  * Click on 'Manage App Permissions' located on the right top corner.
  * Here, you will find apps that have a distribution type of either 'Sub-Account' or 'Agency & Subaccount'.

##   
**Approving Apps:**

By Default:

  * All apps that are in public and live status are approved for your sub-accounts.
  * This default setting also applies to new apps that pass our review process and are made public.

To Approve Disapproved Apps:

  * Under 'App state', select 'Disapproved apps'.
  * For bulk action, choose the apps you wish to approve and click the 'approve' button on the right top corner.

  * Confirm your decision by clicking 'Approve' in the modal window.

  * Once approved, the apps become visible to sub-account users under their App Marketplace. These users can then view and install them.

**For Individual Apps:**

  * Navigate to the app details page by clicking on the specific app.

  * Click 'approve' on the right top corner.
  * Confirm the action by selecting 'Approve' in the modal.

## **Disapproving Apps:**

  * Under 'App state', select 'Approved apps'.

  * For bulk action, choose the apps you wish to disapprove and click the 'disapprove' button on the right top corner.

  * Confirm your decision by typing 'CONFIRM' in the action box and then click on 'disapprove'.

### 

**Effects of Disapproving:**

  * The disapproved apps will no longer be visible or installable at the sub-account level.
  * If these apps were previously installed, they will be uninstalled from all associated sub-accounts. This includes any supplementary features, such as custom conversation providers, workflow actions, triggers, and more.
  * Disapproved apps can be approved again in the future. However, they won't be automatically reinstalled in sub-accounts where they were previously installed. They need to be manually installed again.

##   
**Bulk Approve/Disapprove Marketplace Apps:**

**Disabling this Option:**

  * Click the settings icon on the top right corner.

****

  * Deselect the option 'allow sub-accounts to view and install apps built by 3rd party developers'.
  * Click 'Save'.

****

**  
Effects of Disabling:**

  * Sub-accounts can no longer view or install any marketplace apps. They'll only see an 'App marketplace' option in their left menu, prompting them to contact the agency admin for access.

****

  * All apps will change to a disapproved status.

****

  * Previously installed apps in sub-accounts will be uninstalled.

**  
**

**Re-enabling this Option:**

  * Navigate to 'App Marketplace' from the left menu. (Enable from labs if not visible).
  * Click 'Manage App Permissions' on the top right.
  * Click the settings icon on the top right.
  * Select the box 'allow sub-accounts to view and install apps built by 3rd party developers'.
  * Click 'Save'.

****

### **  
**

****

**Effects of Re-enabling:**

  * All new public apps will automatically be approved for your sub-accounts.
  * All previously approved apps will become visible and installable at the sub-account level.
  * Disapproved apps will remain in their disapproved status until manually approved.
