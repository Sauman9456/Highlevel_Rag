### **Step 1: Choose the widget**

  * Start by choosing a widget from the widget list.  

  * Under the "ALL" filter, the default chart type is automatically selected for each widget.  

  * You can change the chart type by clicking on the chart icon.  

### **Step 2: Configure the widget settings**

  * Head to the "Configure" tab to further customize the widget:
    * **Title** : Change the widget's title according to your conditions. A clear title makes it easier for you and your team to understand.  

    * **Metrics** : Switch data points for your widget  

    * **Group** : Define how your results are grouped in a Donut chart.  

    * **View by** : Pick the secondary dimension for line, bar and horizontal bar chart types  

    * **Breakdown** : Modify the frequency of the time period.  

    * **Date Property** : Adjust the date property for fetching results(for example Created Date or Updated Date)  

    * **Date Range Override** : Override the date range for the widget for the selected date property(by default, it uses the global date range from the dashboard).  

    * **Order** : Alter the order of results (ascending or descending).  

    * **Limit :** Set a limit to simplify the displayed results.
    * **Comparison date property :  **Adds comparison percentage on widget
  * Advanced settings are supplementary configurations that offer extra personalization options for your widget. These settings are not mandatory for creating a widget but can enhance its customization.  

### **Step 3: Add Conditions**

  * Under the "Conditions" tab, apply various filters using AND or OR conditions. Here's how:
    * Click "ADD CONDITION" to add a filter and choose the condition from the dropdown.  

    * Set the operator and parameters for the filter.  

    * You can add or delete conditions as needed.  

  * Note that if there's no data found for a specific filter, you won't be able to save the widget without either deleting that filter from the condition or changing it.  

### **Step 4: Save Changes**

  * After making all the required changes, click the "Save" button.  

  * The widget will be updated on your dashboard. You can resize and reposition it as desired. Remember to click "Save Changes" once you're content with the widget's position and size.  

* * *

    Multiple custom dashboards, widgets and custom reports are available for the $297 and $497+ plans.
