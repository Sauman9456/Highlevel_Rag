_Wondering which plan unlocks the customizable Dashboard?_

It's currently available exclusively for the $497 plan and beyond. If you're on the $97 or $297 plan, we recommend leveling up to unlock this feature. 

Custom dashboards on $497+ plans can be accessed by **Agency Admins** and **Agency users**.
