Drip action is used to limit or prevent a high number of executions simultaneously. Set the batch size and enter the next step in a predetermined number for the given interval.

**INTERNAL TOOLS**

**CONFIGURATION**

### **Batch Size**

Batch size can be set to a minimum of one and a maximum of ten thousand per batch.

### **Drip Interval**

Drip interval can be set in minutes/hours/days ranging from one minute to seven days

### **Example**

Say, 10k contacts enters a workflow, or 5k contacts proceeds from the wait step to the next step. To control the high number of execution you can set a batch size of 50 and an interval of 10 minutes to allow 50 contacts to proceed to the next step every 10 minutes.
