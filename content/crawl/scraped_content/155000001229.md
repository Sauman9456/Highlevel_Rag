Now you can easily copy a workflow from one sub-account to another without going through the full "Snapshot" process. Only Agency Admin will be able to Copy Workflow.  

### **Copy to Sub-Account**

### **Select Sub-Account**

  * Only the sub-accounts that the logged in user has access to will be listed here
  * On submit, the workflow will be copied to the selected sub-account
  * The workflow copied to other sub-account will be in draft state by default

### **Copy Workflow History**

### ****

  * The history of workflows copied to another sub-account are listed with current status for each log

### **Copy Workflow History Details******

  * If any error while copying, you can debug by clicking on that particular history to view detailed info

### **What happens to the assets while copying workflow?  
**

The following assets in the workflow will be copied while copying a workflow to another sub-account:

  * Contact Tags
  * Contact Custom Fields (The field type should be same)
  * Sub-Account Custom Values
  * Opportunity Custom Fields
  * Opportunity Pipelines & stages
  * Email/SMS - text templates
  * Email builder templates (coming soon)

**Note: All the other assets or references will be cleared/removed from the workflow before copying to the selected sub-account.**
