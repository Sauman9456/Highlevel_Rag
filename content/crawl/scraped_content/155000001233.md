## Private and Public Groups

From the "Settings" button within a Community, admins and owners can choose whether they want to set up their group as Public / Private.

## One-Time Payment

One-time payment type will give members an unlimited access of the group after the payment and once they have group access. To set up one-time payment follow the below steps:

  * Log into the Community
  * Go to "Settings" > "Subscriptions"
  * Click on "Add new price": Specify the __Amount__ , __Type__ as one-time
  * Click "Add" and then "Save" to create the paid group with One-time Payment
    *  _Note_ : to test a payment, turn on the __Test Mode__
  * Once saved, the group description will reflect the same information to members who want to join

## Recurring Subscription

Recurring subscription type will give members a limited access of the group after the payment and once they have group access. To set up the recurring subscription, follow the below steps:

  * Log into the Community
  * Go to "Settings" > "Subscriptions"
  * Click on "Add new price": Specify the __Amount__ , __Type__ as Recurring, __Trial Days_  _(if any), __Billing Period__ as Monthly or Annually
  * Click "Add" and then "Save" to create the paid group with Recurring Subscription
  * Additionally, to test a payment, turn on the __Test Mode__
  * Once saved, the group description will reflect the same information to members who want to join

## Group Access

To grant access after receiving the payment:  

  * Once the payment is made, admins and owners need to follow the same process of providing access to members for Private Groups (Go to People Tab > Click on the Filter > Requested > Accept or Deny Membership)
  * For Public Groups, once the payment is made the user signs up and becomes a member right after

## Notifications

  * All admins and owners receive email notification about the payment made by a user with all the details, to join the group and subsequently to request membership (as per group type)
  * Similarly, the users also receive a payment confirmation with all the details about their payment 
  * Once their membership is approved by admin or owner. They are further notified about their membership and access of the group  

## Cancellations and Refunds

  * **What happens when a member cancels their subscription from the GHL Payments screen?**  
  
When a user cancels their subscription from the GHL Payments screen, several actions are initiated:  
\- The user will receive a cancellation confirmation email.

  * **If a user's contact card is deleted and later restored, will the user need to make the payment again?**  
  
As of the current system functionality, when a user's contact card is accidentally deleted and then restored, the user should be reinstated in the Group without being required to make the payment again.
