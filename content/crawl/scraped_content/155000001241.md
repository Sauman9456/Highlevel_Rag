Modified on: Wed, 28 Aug, 2024 at 10:54 AM

Use a filter to segregate and view specific data on your opportunity board. Filters support both standard and custom fields

## Creating a Filter

Filters can be accessed by clicking the filter icon in the top right corner of the opportunities board. Multiple filters can be applied at the same time in two different configurations (explained below)

## Filter Conditions

Two types of filter conditional logic are possible: AND and OR

  * AND - Every condition must be met for each opportunity
  * OR - At least one condition must be met for each opportunity

These filter conditions can be changed using the toggle on the top right of the filter right sidebar

## Filter Types

The filters are divided into 2 groups:

  1. Standard Filters - Based on opportunity activity and standard fields
    1. Owner
    2. Status
    3. Campaign Type - This filter allows you to filter based on which campaign the opportunity was created from in case it was created from a campaign. You can find campaigns in the platform under Automations. Please note any further development on campaigns has been discontinued. 
    4. Last Stage Change
    5. Created on
    6. Updated on
    7. Lead Value
    8. Opportunity won on
    9. Opportunity lost on
  2. Custom Filters - Filters for Custom fields in opportunities (except File Upload and Signature Field)
