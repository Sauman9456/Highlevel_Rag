There are 3 types of configuration available for contact filtering. They help create every type of filtered view required to visualize and understand your contacts

**In This Article**

    * AND condition
    * OR Condition
    * AND and OR Combined

* * *

## AND condition

Every AND condition must be met for each contact this is available in that smart list.

Example: Contacts with a specific tag also having both an email AND a phone

## OR Condition

At least one OR condition must be met for each contact that is available in that smartlist.

Example: Contacts having either an email OR a phone OR having a certain tag

## AND and OR Combined

Groups of AND filters can be used with the OR condition among them for higher customization in filtering.

Example: Contact having both an email AND phone OR just an address

    All the internal operators like IS, IS NOT, IS EMPTY, IS NOT EMPTY, CONTAINS, DOES NOT CONTAIN etc are not available for all filter fields yet.
