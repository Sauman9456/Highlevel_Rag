# Automatic invoice creation after Document/Contract is signed

Modified on: Sat, 16 Mar, 2024 at 1:00 AM

  * Businesses would be able to have an invoice created automatically after the potential lead accepts/signs the document/contract
  * The generated invoice would be a replica of the line items, taxes, and discounts applied on the products list element inside the document/contract
  * The business would be able to directly review the invoice, make any edits if required, and send it to the client for payment using the 

View Invoice

 action in the Finalized list view
  * An invoice will not be created if there are no product line items associated with the document/contract
  * A cumulative invoice of all the line items and discounts associated with each element will be created in case multiple product list elements exist inside the document
