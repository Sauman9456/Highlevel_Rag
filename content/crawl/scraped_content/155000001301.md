  * Businesses will now be able to create document/contract templates. This will enable quick and easy sending of documents and will also enable automatically sending the document in a workflow using the same templates created
  * Users will be able to convert any existing document created into a template using the 

Convert to Template

 action and give an appropriate name to it for future references
  * Templates can contain all information related to your document/contract apart from the recipient information
  * Users will also be able to assign signature elements to themselves inside the templates in case one of the signees is a business user in every document/contract they send to a potential client
  * All templates will be listed on the Templates page under Documents and Contracts. Quick actions on the templates page will enable the use of the template
  * Users will be able to modify, rename, or delete the templates at any point in time

#### **Businesses will be able to make use of the same templates created to automatically send Documents/Contracts inside a workflow**  

  * Businesses will now be able to configure the 

Send document/contract

 action inside the workflows to automatically send a document based on a trigger
  * Users will be able to make use of the templates created inside the Documents & Contracts module to define the document details that need to go out to the customer.
  * Business users will be able to configure the action name, select the From User to define the sender details and choose a template from one of the templates created inside Documents & Contracts
  * The default/custom template configured inside the Documents & Contracts settings will be used automatically to send the document from workflows as well
  * This fulfills use cases like automatically sending documents after opportunity status is changed, or a tag is attached to a contact, or using any other trigger
  * This will also allow achieving the use case where the business wants to send out documents to potential clients with one signature field attached to one of the business users and the other for the potential client. They can create document templates with a signature element assigned to the business user and leave the unassigned signature element will automatically get assigned to the potential lead
