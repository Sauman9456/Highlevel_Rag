##  _How to create and share unique invite links_

Admins and Owners now have the ability to generate unique invite links from the invite page. Follow these steps to create an Invite Link:

  * **Step 1:** Navigate to the 'People' tab in your group.
  * **Step 2:** Click on the 'Invite' option.
  * **Step 3:** Choose 'Invitation link' to generate a unique link.

Once you've generated the invite link, you can easily share it with potential members. Here's how:

  * **Step 1:** Copy the generated invite link.
  * **Step 2:** Share the link through various communication channels, both within and outside the system. This means you can send it through email, messaging apps, social media, or any other preferred method.  

## _Invited Members_

For members who receive an invitation via an invite link, here's what to expect:

  * **Step 1:** Click on the invite link you received.
  * **Step 2:** A personalized pop-up modal will appear.

In this modal, you have the following options:

  * **Option 1:** Sign up for a new account if you are not already a member.
  * **Option 2:** Log in with your existing credentials if you are a registered member.
  * **_Note_** : It's important to note that even when using invite links, the standard approval process still applies for private groups. This ensures that only approved members gain access to the group, maintaining its security and integrity.
