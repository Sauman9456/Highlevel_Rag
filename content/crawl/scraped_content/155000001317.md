# How to customize the onboarding email that is sent to new sub-account users?

Modified on: Thu, 13 Jun, 2024 at 11:33 AM

SaaS agencies can now customize the email that is sent to newly added sub-account users.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * Step 1: Go to SaaS Configurator > Advanced Settings > Customize Welcome Email

  * Step 2: Select sub-account

  * Step 3: Customize the template

  * Step 4: Save

* * *

### **Step 1: Go to SaaS Configurator > Advanced Settings > Customize Welcome Email > Customize Now**  

### **Step 2: Select the sub-account where you want to store the email template. Select 'Customize Email'.**

****

### **Step 3: In the email builder that opens up, customize the layout, add custom values, implement brand theme etc.**

###   

### **Step 4: Select 'Save'.**

****  

    As mentioned above, the template is stored in the sub-account selected at the time of defining the template for the first time. Please DO NOT DELETE the email template at its source. Upon doing so, the customization will be lost and all emails going forward will fall back to the default email template.
