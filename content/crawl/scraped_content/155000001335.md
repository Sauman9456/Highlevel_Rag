## Conversation AI Modes and settings

The Conversation AI bot has 3 modes for your sub-account:

  1. OFF - This is the default mode where the conversation AI feature is inactive. Bot training and bot trial are still active to train and test the bot before launching the bot
  2. Suggestive - The bot responses are available inside the message composer box for the sub-account user to send as is or edit before sending.
  3. Auto-pilot - The bot automatically responds to a contact on behalf of the business.

## Supported conversation channels

The bot currently supports the following channels:

  1. SMS
  2. FB
  3. IG
  4. Web Chat (SMS Chat)
  5. Live Chat
  6. GBP (Google Business Profile)

You can select which channels you'd like the bot to communicate through by going to "Settings" > "Conversation AI" and adding the channels via the "Supported Channels" dropdown:

    If there is a channel that you would like us to add, please add an idea to the ideas board here <https://highlevel.canny.io/conversation-ai>

## [Training the Bot](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000000996)

There are 2 ways to train your bot in the "Bot Training" section of the Conversation AI settings page in your sub-account settings:

  1. [Through web URLs and public links](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001338)
  2. Adding Question and Answer pairs

    Note: Bot training is free of cost

## Configuring Bot's Intent

Currently, there are 2 intents supported by the bot:

  1. General Support or Q/A - Provides information to the contact's queries based on the training information
  2. Appointment Booking - Ask a few questions (customizable) and then book an appointment on the calendar.  
Note: If an appointment for a contact is already booked ie in the Active/Confirmer state, the intent will dynamically switch to General support for that contact till the appointment is either completed or cancelled

## Testing the Bot (Bot Trial)

  * The Conversation AI bot is FREE to test in the "Bot Trial" tab of your Conversation AI Sub-account settings page. 
  * The intent to test can be selected from the dropdown and the bot will respond to you the same way it will respond to a contact
  * Feedback can be provided by using the "Thumbs Up and Down" under each bot's response to fine-tune and add FaQs to be trained

## Workflow X Conversation AI

Utilize the power of your bot training within workflows by using the Conversation AI Action following:

  1. Customization your entire prompt 
  2. Conditional movement of the contact within the workflow
  3. Ask specific questions and create branches based on the contact's reply
