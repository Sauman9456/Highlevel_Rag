Bot training equips the Conversation AI Bot with the knowledge and information needed to understand your business and respond to users. There are 2 ways to train your bot in the "Bot Training" section of the Conversation AI settings page in your sub-account settings:

  1. Web Crawler - Through web URLs and public links
  2. Customize Bot Responses - Adding Question and Answer pairs

* * *

## **Train Your Conversation AI Bot with Web URLs**

The bot can be trained by providing URLs to webpages and blogs (yes, plural) to help the bot understand your business and respond to your contacts effectively.

There are 3 different web crawling modes available.

  1. Exact URL
  2. All URLs on this Path
  3. All URLs on the Domain

[Read more here for each crawling mode and managing the uploaded links using the table](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001338)

Enter a URL and click "Get Data". Follow the steps to train the bot.

* * *

## **Manually Update Your Conversation AI Bot with Question & Answers**

Manually add question-answer pairs to customize your bot's responses. This method allows you to fine-tune the bot's knowledge to address specific questions from your users. Add Q/A by:

  1. Access the "Conversation AI" settings in the sub-account
  2. Locate the "Bot Training" tab
  3. Click "+ Add FaQ" and provide a question and its answer
  4. Repeat this process for each question-answer pair

Q/A can also be added by providing feedback ("Thumbs Down") to the Bot's response in the "Bot Trial" and the conversation/contact screens.
