### **How do I turn on re-billing for my clients?**

  1. If the sub-account isn't in SaaS Mode already, switch the sub-account into SaaS Mode by going into your **Agency account** > **Accounts tab  **> **Scroll to the sub-account** > Click the **three dots icon** and select "**Switch to SaaS.** " Please refer to this article to learn [How to convert a location to SaaS](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001184920).
  2.  In **Agency account** > **Accounts tab** > Scroll to the **Sub-Account** > Click the three dots -> **Manage Client** > **Click the Rebilling tab** section -> find **Conversation AI and toggle it on.**
  3. Use the slider to set the amount of markup you like to make and hit save!  

  4. Rinse and repeat for all your Sub-Accounts where you wish to rebill for usage.

       **NOTE:  **Use the "**Conversation AI** " tab in "**Agency Settings** " for easy enabling of Rebilling for the subaccounts
