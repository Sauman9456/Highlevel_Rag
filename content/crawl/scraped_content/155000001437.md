# How to send confirmations after purchase of orders

Modified on: Wed, 15 Nov, 2023 at 2:41 AM

Business users are able to send automated confirmation emails after any purchase is done across the system using the automated sales receipts which list the products purchased along with the total amount paid.  
  
Businesses can also make use of the purchased webhook information to process any external automations using the data sent from workflows using the **Order Submitted** trigger

If the use case is to send an automated confirmation, you can use the automated sales receipts feature -  [](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000261-how-to-enable-sales-receipts-for-order-form-calendar-and-invoice-payments?fbclid=IwAR2hcbhX2EFrQQpEM4Ne85HkRFhHQVJ3g0Soxl5IP9PF0l5iyZ7HTHf7EGg)<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000261-how-to-enable-sales-receipts-for-order-form-calendar-and-invoice-payments>

The order submitted trigger can also be used with a custom email template along with the shopping cart element inside the email builder to send a customized email listing the products purchased inside the email body content. Refer to the help article for the order submitted trigger here
