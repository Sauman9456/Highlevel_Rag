#### **How to create Equipments?**

**1\. Access Calendar Settings and Enable Equipments:**

  * Go to your account and navigate to Calendars > Calendar Settings.
  * Under Preferences > In App Preferences, toggle on Rooms and Equipments.

**2\. Create an Equipment:**

  * Once you've enabled the feature, a new 'Equipments' tab will appear.
  * Under the 'Equipment' tab > Click on Create Equipment. 

**3\. Provide Equipment Details:**

  * To set up equipment, enter the following details:
    * **Equipment Name:** Assign a unique name to the equipment.
    * **Description:** Provide a brief description to clarify the equipment's purpose.
    * **Total Quantity:** Specify the total number of available equipment units.
    * **Out of Service Quantity:** Enter the count of equipment units that are currently non-functional, require repair, or are out of service.
    * **Select Calendar:** Choose the calendars you wish to associate with this equipment.

    Note: You can only link one equipment to each calendar. For example, if you have a 'Laser Machine', it can be connected to multiple calendars, but each calendar can only have one equipment, here 'Laser Machine' associated with it.

#### **Additional Information**

**1\. Rooms and Equipment Details:**

  * Find your rooms and equipment details within the **appointment modal - details view.**
  * This ensures you can now easily identify which room has been **assigned** to a particular appointment and which equipment is being used or has been booked in conjunction with the appointment.
  * This feature simplifies the management of appointments, making it more informative and streamlined.
