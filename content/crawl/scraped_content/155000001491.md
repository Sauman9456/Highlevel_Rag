  * Business users are able to utilize the Documents & Contracts trigger to trigger a workflow for use cases based upon the change in the state of a document
  * This will allow businesses with multiple use cases, like updating opportunity tags, sending an invoice, attaching tags to contacts, or maintaining any record through actions like Google Sheets/Slack after the Document has been sent/signed by one of the recipients or completed by all participants
  * Users will be able to filter the trigger based on specific conditions like the document status, value, Template name or the recipient type.
  * The most common use case can be to trigger a workflow based on the document status

  1. Sent

 \- Triggers the workflow when the document has been marked as Sent by the business
  2. **Viewed  **\- Triggers the workflow when the document has been viewed by anyone apart from the business user who sent it
  3. Signed/Accepted

 \- Based on the condition that it has been 

signed by one of the recipients

 of the document (Useful in case of multiple recipients receiving the document and the business needs to maintain a record whenever any recipient has signed/accepted it)
  4. Completed 

\- Triggers the workflow when the document has been signed by all recipients who received the document

  * Another use case can be to trigger a different workflow based on the Template Name, i.e., if a different kind of sequence of actions need to be taken for different kinds of templates such as Sales Proposals or NDAs or Deal Closure Agreement.  

  * Another use case can be to trigger a different workflow based on whether the document is going to the Recipient Contact or the Business User itself  

  * Business users will also be able to create 

If/Else

branches based on the above conditions along with value or document type criteria to branch the workflow based on the specific filters
  * Custom values will also function for the specific contact to fulfill any use cases or send out custom notifications upon specific events or conditions
  * This will also help in building reminder sequences if the document has not been signed by the contact and the business wants to
