# How To Reduce 'Spam Likely' by Registering your Numbers on Free Caller Registry

Modified on: Thu, 7 Dec, 2023 at 9:43 PM

From time to time, you might notice that your outbound calls are being labeled as "Spam Likely" or "Scam Likely" when reaching out to potential leads. To address this issue and remove such nuisance labels from your numbers, we recommend registering your tracking numbers using the [Free Caller Registry.](https://freecallerregistry.com/fcr/)

It's important to note that this registration process is specifically designed for U.S. phone numbers. If you're dealing with international numbers, we suggest getting in touch with the terminating carrier responsible for marking your outbound calls as spam. Requesting adjustments to your outbound caller ID through the respective carrier can help resolve this matter.
