## **Activating the Service Menu**

In order to start working on creating Service Menus and Service Calendars, you need to activate it from the "Account Preferences" in Calendar Settings. Once you've toggled the button to activate the Service Menu, scroll down and click on "Save Preferences" to save your changes. A new tab named "Service Menu" will now appear right next to Calendars and Groups.

**Calendars** >> **Calendar Settings** >> **Preferences** >> **Account Preference**

## 

## **Creating Groups**

The fundamental structure of a well-organized service calendar involves the creation of groups. These groups serve as categorical containers for related services such as Dent Removal, Headlight Restoration, Ceramic Coating, and Window Tinting. Each group acts as an organizational unit, enhancing clarity and coherence.

**Calendars** >> **Calendar Settings** >> **Groups** >> **Create Group**

Add the **Group Name** , **Group Description** , and **Group URL** or unique SLUG, then click the blue **Create** button.

## **Configuring Service Calendars**

Once the foundational group/s is established, the subsequent step is the creation of individual **_Service Calendars_**. This process outlines the setup of a new service calendar using Dent Removal as an example. The procedure includes _Naming the calendar_ , _selecting staff members_ , _assigning a URL_ , and _defining the service duration_. Advanced settings, encompassing descriptions and group allocations, offer nuanced customization to adapt to specific business requirements.

**Please Note** :

    The Service Calendar will only be available upon activating the Service Menu under Account Preferences in Calendar Settings.(See first step)

Add the name of the service (ex., Dent Removal, Wheel Restoration, etc.), then Select a Staff Member that is assigned to that particular service. Add the Custom URL or unique SLUG then choose the duration of the service from the dropdown. Once done, click the blue Confirm button.

**Please Note** :

    Staff members can be added by going to Settings >> My Staff >> Add Employee.
    This should be done first as the calendar won't allow you to save or press the blue confirm button unless you choose a staff member from the dropdown option.

## **Adjusting Calendar Settings**

Advanced settings are explored further, encompassing detailed adjustments such as adding descriptions, allocating calendars to specific groups, and customizing appointment titles. This level of customization allows businesses to tailor their service calendars to suit their unique needs, ensuring seamless integration with existing workflows.

You can edit the Service Calendar you created by clicking on the three dots next to it and by choosing **Edit** from the options.

## **Adding Images and further customization**

Images are included within service calendars to elevate the user experience. This step involves uploading visually relevant images for each service, providing clients with a visually appealing representation. Additional customization options, including enabling rescheduling and canceling, contribute to creating a polished and user-friendly service calendar.

## **Creating the Service Menus**

The final phase involves the creation of service menus that showcase selected service calendars. This section underscores the significance of arranging services within the menu.

Armed with this knowledge, businesses can optimize their scheduling processes and elevate customer satisfaction.**
