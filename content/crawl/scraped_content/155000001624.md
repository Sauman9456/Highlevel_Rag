Additionally if you want to send business initiated conversations then please ensure that you have an approved template in place. [How to create a WhatsApp Template](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000861-how-to-create-a-whatsapp-template-)

# FAQs

## **Does the Do Not Disturb (DND) setting affect other communication channels or just WhatsApp?**

You can configure DND to apply to all channels or just WhatsApp. This gives you control over whether you want to prevent the customer from receiving communications across all methods or just on the particular channel where they requested to be left alone.

## **What's the difference between "None - Manual Text" and selecting a template when sending WhatsApp messages in workflows?**

"None - Manual Text" lets you write a free-form message within the 24-hour window. Selecting a template is for sending pre-approved messages, which is useful for starting conversations outside of the 24-hour window or for specific marketing or support purposes.

## **Can I create workflows that combine WhatsApp with other channels like SMS or Email?**

Yes! GoHighLevel workflows are flexible, allowing you to combine WhatsApp with other communication channels to create comprehensive automation sequences.

## **Can I use WhatsApp workflow automation to send messages outside the 24-hour window?**

Yes, you can use approved WhatsApp templates after the initial 24-hour window for outreach or follow-up messages. Keep in mind that these template-based messages will incur additional charges.

## **What's a 'Free Entry Point Conversation' and how is it different from a regular conversation?**

  * Triggered when a customer clicks a "Click to WhatsApp" ad or a Facebook Call-to-Action button.
  * Lasts for 72 hours, compared to the standard 24-hour window.
  * During this extended window, you can send both free-form and template messages.

## **What happens if a customer replies with something other than what I've configured for the 'Wait for WhatsApp Reply' step?**

The workflow will continue to wait until they send a reply that matches what you've set up. If you want to handle unexpected responses, consider adding additional branches to your workflow with alternative conditions.
