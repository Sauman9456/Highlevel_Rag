Our embed widget element empowers you to seamlessly integrate a wide range of online content into your GHL dashboards using iframes. If a platform supports embedded content, you can effortlessly display it within your dashboards. This feature enables the inclusion of various elements like web pages, Google Data Studio reports, Google Docs,  slideshows, calendars, Loom videos, YouTube videos, social media posts, feeds, and more.

  * In the "Type" section, choose "URL" to embed a specific URL. Ensure the URL is fully qualified.

## **Embedding different types of content:**

### **1\. Youtube**

  * Add an Embed element, then add the video's ID number (found after /video/ in the URL) to https://www.youtube.com/embed/

  * For example if your youtube URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFTIQDCvIrc , then copy the video ID "bFTIQDCvIrc" and add it to [https://www.youtube.com/embed/](https://www.youtube.com/embed/). So your final URL will be [https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFTIQDCvIrc](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFTIQDCvIrc)

### **2\. TikTok videos**

  * Add an Embed element, then add the video's ID number (found after /video/ in the URL) to https://www.tiktok.com/embed/

### **2\. Instagram Posts**

  * Get the sharable link for your instagram post.  You'll get a link similar to this:  
https://www.instagram.com/p/C04TE0DsEkW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

  * You'll need to replace ?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link with /embed/. The URL should look like this afterward:  
https://www.instagram.com/p/C04TE0DsEkW/embed/

  * Add this final URL on your embed element configuration.

* * *

## **Note:**** **

  1. Some platforms or websites do not allow their content to be displayed in an iframe.
  2. _Wondering which plan unlocks the customizable Dashboard and widgets?_  
_It's currently available exclusively for the $497 plan and beyond. If you're on the $97 or $297 plan, we recommend leveling up to unlock this feature.  _
