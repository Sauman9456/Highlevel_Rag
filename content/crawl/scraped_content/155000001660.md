## **Hiding Elements**

Add an interactive layer to designs by hiding elements when a button is clicked. 

1\. In the funnel or website builder, choose the _**Button elemen**_**t** that you want to use.

2\. On the right side of the screen, you'll find the element settings. Under **_General_** , scroll all the way down to "**_Button Actions_** ".

3\. Choose "**_Hide Elements"_** from the dropdown. Click on the button that says "_**No Elements**_ " and choose the element or elements that you'd like to hide when the button is clicked. 

4\. You can choose an **_element_** , a _**section**_ , a _**  column,**_ or _**  column rows**_. Once done choosing which ones to hide, click the **_Save_** button, and preview your funnel or website to test.

## **Showing Elements**

**Similarly, you can reveal hidden elements when a button is clicked.**

1\. Select an element you want to "Show" from a "Hidden" state and go to **_Advanced Settings_**. For this example, we will be using a Form to be revealed when a button is clicked.

2\. Locate the **_Visibility_** section. Click on each mobile and desktop visibility buttons to "hide" the elements in both views.

3\. In the funnel or website builder, choose the _**Button element**_ that you want to reveal the hidden element  when clicked.

4\. On the right side you'll find the element settings. Under **_General_** , scroll down to "**_Button Actions_** ".

5\. Choose "**_Show Elements"_** from the dropdown. Click the "_**No Elements**_ " button and choose the element or elements that you'd like to show when the the button is clicked. 

**Helpful Tip** : 

    Name your element/s with an identifying label so it's easier to find them from the list.

6\. Once you have chosen which element/s to show when the button is clicked, click the **_Save_**  button, and preview your funnel or website to test.
