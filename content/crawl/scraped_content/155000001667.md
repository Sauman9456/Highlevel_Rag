## How to generate and use Magic Links:

Users can effortlessly generate magic links directly from the Client Portal Dashboard for individual client portal child apps, including Courses, Communities, and Affiliates. 

  1. **Go to Client Portal Dashboard:** Navigate to the client portal dashboard on Highlevel platform.
  2. **Access Actions Menu:** Click on the "Actions" menu located in the dashboard.
  3. **Generate Magic Link:** Select the "Generate Magic Link" option from the menu.
  4. **Choose Relevant App:** Choose the relevant Contact or Client Portal child app (Courses, Communities, or Affiliates) for which you want to generate the magic link.
  5. **Generate the Link:** Click on the "Generate" button to create the magic link for the selected app or contact
  6. **Utilize the Magic Link:** Once generated, use the magic link to access the chosen app directly without the need for a separate sign-in process.  

## How to use magic links as custom menu links:

  * Magic links can be seamlessly embedded as custom menu items within the client portal.
  * To use Custom Menu magic links, go to **Agency ➝ Settings ➝ Custom Links**  and add your desired link as a menu item

     _Sub-Account and agency users can now enjoy the convenience of direct access to their respective child apps without undergoing a separate sign-in process. This not only saves time but also enhances the overall user experience._
