## Create Contactless Tasks

Create tasks on the task list page without a contact specifically for your team members. These tasks can be used to manage work and responsibilities within your team easily

## Filter Internal Tasks

Utilize the "Unassigned" option in the "Contact" filter field to filter out contactless/internal tasks for your team.

## Assign, remove, or Reassign the Contact to a task

Along with creating contactless tasks, the contact can be added, removed, or reassigned anytime post a task is created giving you absolute control over managing the tasks in your subaccount 

## 

    These tasks are also visible in the Tasks list on the Dashboard page.
