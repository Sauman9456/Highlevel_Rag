#### **How to Generate Dynamic One-Time Links**

To generate dynamic One-Time Links within your workflow, follow these simple steps:

#### **1\. Create a Workflow:** Start by creating a workflow in your account. Define the trigger that initiates the workflow based on your specific needs.

#### **2\. Add the 'Generate One-Time Booking Link' Action:** Within your workflow, add an action. Navigate to the 'Appointments' category and select 'Generate One Time Booking Link.'

#### **3\. Choose the calendar** for which you want to generate the one-time link.

#### **4\. Share the Generated Link:** To share the link with your contact, add a communication action (e.g., email) to your workflow.

#### **5\. Add the Custom Value:** Insert the unique one-time link that will get generated each time a trigger is activated, into the email body using a custom value. Select 'Generate One Time Booking Link' and choose 'One Time Link.'

#### **6\. Customize Email Body:** Customize the email body as needed and click 'Save.'

####   
**7\. Publish Workflow:** Once your workflow is set up, publish it. Now, each time a contact enters the workflow triggered by your defined condition, a unique one-time link will be generated and sent to them via email.
