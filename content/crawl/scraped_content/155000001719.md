# Notifications inside Client Portal

Modified on: Wed, 20 Mar, 2024 at 11:52 AM

The Client Portal Notifications feature consolidates all notifications from the client portal and its associated child apps into a centralised location – the Notifications Tab. This allows users to conveniently access and manage all their notifications within the application.
