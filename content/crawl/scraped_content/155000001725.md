## How to access the importer

  * Go to Memberships > Courses > Products > Create Product > Import  
  
**  
**

## **Best Practices:**

  * To optimize your experience, it's recommended to refrain from using custom CSS. 

  * Create a backup of your themes. This precautionary step allows you to revert to your original settings if needed.
  * Initiate the migration during off-hours to minimize any potential impact on your learners while using the course.

##   

## **Steps to import course**

Follow these steps to import your courses:

### **Step 1: Create a Learner profile**

  * Create a learner profile on _the platform you are importing from_

    * Ensure you are creating a new contact _within the platform you are importing from_  

  * Once created, go back to the Course Importer screen and enter the email and password you used to create the account in the previous step.

  * Add the learner domain in the domain field (the domain where you enter learner login credentials).

  * Click the "Import" button  

### **Step 2: Importing process**

  * Once the import process has started, it will log you in via learner credentials and start importing the courses.
  * While progress will be shown, make sure to click the "Refresh" button to get an accurate status.
  * To cancel the importing process, click the "Cancel" button.
  * Tabs can be switched while importing, but _do not close the tab or window_.
  * All videos, images and text content will be migrated for courses (and lessons).

    Note: The import will only bring in lessons that have been published. Additionally, the assignments, quizzes, and assessments will not be included in the import process.  
      
    **The preferred themes for the Library and Product sections are Encore Site and Premier Product, respectively.**

### **Step 3: Successful importation  **

  * Once the courses are successfully imported, they will appear under the **Products** section.

  * Last updated will appear under the Import section, stating when the last process took place.

## **FAQs**

  * **What causes an authentication error?**  

Authentication errors appear when the added domain or credentials are incorrect. To resolve this, carefully verify the credentials again and ensure they are correct before initiating the import process.

  * **What causes a "course import failed" error****?  
**  
Possible reasons for import failure:
    * **Incorrect Theme:** Ensure that the selected theme is correct.
    * **Credential Verification:** Double-check the accuracy of the provided credentials.
    * **Valid Domain:** Confirm that the provided domain is compatible with the "/login" path. For example, "domainName/login" should lead to the login page.
    * **Retry Option:** If the import fails, users can click on "retry" to resume the process from where it left off.
    * **Cancellation Clarification:** If a user cancels the import, it will be considered as canceled by the user, and any new imports will start from the beginning.
