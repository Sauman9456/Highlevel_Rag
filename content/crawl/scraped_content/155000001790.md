## Q: What is Meta Messaging Limit

Messaging limits on Meta control the maximum number of new, business-initiated conversations you can start with customers within a 24-hour rolling period.

## Q: How can I check my current messaging limits?

You can check your current messaging limits on Meta by going to WhatsApp Manager > Overview Dashboard > Insights tab.

## Q. What is a quality rating, and how does it affect my messaging limit?

Your quality rating reflects how well customers receive your messages over a 7-day period. Factors like user blocks, reports, and reasons for blocking impact this rating. A "Low" quality rating can decrease your messaging limit.

## Q How to maintain High Quality Rating

  * Make sure messages follow the [WhatsApp Business Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/?fbclid=IwAR3yDsNgje8Ks7_mm7uCNbCirZ7VD8eR5_1u6cQYqbF7cIB_e3eSZfzXxZc) and [Commerce Policy](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whatsapp.com%2Flegal%2Fcommerce-policy%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3Sp4288z3r4lfjFgOwVzAaQj0iy0VZQxmDjuZFRgJR5ne1vJdqyEoC9KM&h=AT0nmsNykL5GCpxSlH5zjP9xRZ5JjgE5Jrlxk91m_QQTT0h-p0S_9JEqfLDCuwLTxJ336WYmForqeo_BSqaLBkuRpFatpZl_snkX76GX4II6gjXy5IKElCjDix9ZdbTH8OTbW6BdDAH5QtL6FytQVJh_r4c).

  * Only send messages to users who have opted into receiving messages from your business.
  * Make the messages highly personalized and useful to users. Avoid sending open-ended welcome or introductory messages.
  * Be mindful of messaging frequency; avoid sending customers too many messages a day. Be thoughtful of informational messages, optimizing for content and length.
