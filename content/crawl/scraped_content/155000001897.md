# My Affiliate Commission Looks Incorrect

Modified on: Wed, 31 Jan, 2024 at 11:58 AM

Does your commission amount look different from what you were expecting?

Here are a few potential causes:

  * If HighLevel is running a promo, such as a Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal, usual commission amounts could be lower than normal.
  * If the commission is the product of a referral upgrading their HighLevel plan, the commission amount will be prorated in accordance with the day of the upgrade.
  * If your referred customer receives a refund from the HighLevel team, it will show up as a negative balance in your portal.
    * Note: An overall negative balance does **not** mean you owe money, but you will need to generate enough commission to counteract the negative amount in order to receive a payout.

If your commission amount looks correct but you’re not receiving the payments, please refer to [this article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001896-where-is-my-affiliate-payout-).
