# How to inject User/Sub account Properties in Iframes on Sub Account Dashboards

Modified on: Mon, 12 Feb, 2024 at 2:13 AM

You can now inject dynamic user or sub account properties/parameters in embedded content using iframes. Follow these step-by-step instructions to get started:

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

      * Step 1: Enter Edit Mode
      * Step 2: Navigate to Objects tab
      * Step 3: Choose Embed
      * Step 4: Enter the URL
      * Step 5: Add Parameters
      * Step 6: Utilize Dynamic User Properties
  * Supported User Properties

* * *

### **Step 1: Enter Edit Mode**

  * Open your Sub Account Dashboard and enter Edit mode.

### **Step 2: Navigate to Objects tab**

  * Once in Edit mode, navigate to the Objects section.

### **Step 3: Choose Embed**

  * Select the Embed option from the Objects menu.

### **Step 4: Enter the URL**

  * Enter the URL of the content you want to embed into the dashboard.

### **Step 5: Add Parameters**

  * After entering the URL, add the required parameters to customize the content.

### **Step 6: Utilize Dynamic User Properties**

  * You can dynamically inject the sub-account or user identifier into the iframe source. You can use placeholders like {{location.id}} or {{location.name}} in the URL to make it more versatile.

  * As an example, you can use {{location.id}} to create a dynamic URL like this: <https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/location/{{location.id}}/conversations>.

  * You can embed the above link as an iFrame URL on your dashboard.

* * *

# Supported User Properties

  1. We support various user properties that can be passed in the URL. Replace the **property** in {{user.**userpropertyhere**}} with any of the following supported user properties:
     * companyId
     * email
     * phone
     * role
     * type
     * firstName
     * lastName
     * name
     * fullName
  2. For example, you can use https://yourwebsiteurlhere.com/?user={{user.firstName}} to pass the user's first name in the URL.
