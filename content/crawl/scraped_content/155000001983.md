# Understanding Opportunities in HighLevel

Modified on: Mon, 20 May, 2024 at 10:20 AM

Opportunities in HighLevel represent potential sales or deals at various stages of the sales pipeline.

They encapsulate leads or prospects showing interest in products/services, ripe for conversion into paying customers.

**Key Concepts:**

## Pipeline Integration

##   

  * Opportunities are managed within pipelines which in turn are series of consecutive stages.
  * Customizable pipelines align with unique sales processes and business goals.

Learn more about pipelines [here](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/155000001982?portalId=48000045315)

## Stage Progression

  * Opportunities advance through pipeline stages, signifying their position in the sales cycle.
  * Stages typically include "Prospecting," "Qualification," "Proposal," and "Negotiation"

## Opportunity Status

  * "Open", "Won", "Lost" and "Abandoned" are opportunity status which are present by default.
  * An opportunity can be in one of the four statuses and we can use these to prepare filters for the same.

# **Understanding Opportunity Statuses:**

  1. #### **Open:**

     * #### Opportunities with the "Open" status are actively being pursued and are still in progress.

     * These opportunities represent potential deals that have not yet been won, lost, or abandoned and are still viable for conversion.  

  2. #### **Won:**

     * The "Won" status indicates that the opportunity has been successfully converted into a sale or deal.
     * This status is applied when the lead has made a purchase or signed a contract, resulting in revenue generation for the business.  

  3. #### **Lost:**

     * Opportunities with the "Lost" status represent deals that have been unsuccessfully concluded.
     * This status is applied when the lead decides not to move forward with the purchase or chooses a competitor's offering.  

  4. #### **Abandoned:**

     * The "Abandoned" status indicates that the opportunity has been neglected or disregarded, either by the lead or by the sales team.
     * This status is applied when there is no further action or follow-up planned for the opportunity, and it is effectively removed from active consideration.

## Data Management 

  * Robust data management within opportunities tracks opportunity source, contact details, opportunity value, and notes.
  * Users can also streamline communication and task assignment under Opportunity - linked contacts, enhancing workflow efficiency and timely engagement.
