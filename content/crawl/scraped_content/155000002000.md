## How to track all activities in my opportunity and find the Opportunity ID?

  1. Open the Opportunity by clicking on the Opportunity card
  2. Observe the Opportunity ID in the bottom left and click on the same.
  3. You will be redirected to the audit logs for that opportunity. 
  4. Audit logs allow you to monitor any activity that has taken place on the opportunity in the last 60 days.

## How does the Labs feature of Multiple Contacts per Opportunity currently work? (currently in Labs > Subaccounts)

  1. Open the Opportunity by clicking on the Opportunity card
  2. In the Additional Contacts field - you can add any contact that you would like to link to the opportunity
  3. A contact which is added as the primary in the opportunity cannot also be added in it's additional contact list.

# Custom Fields

## How can I see my custom fields in an Opportunity?

When you go to 'Opportunities' and select or create an opportunity, you'll see your custom fields listed. When you edit an opportunity, these fields are available for input. If you've organized your fields into folders, these will appear one after the other.

## What does the 'hide empty fields' feature do?

When enabled, the 'hide empty fields' feature hides all fields with no value. This allows you to focus only on fields that are relevant or required for you, providing a cleaner, more streamlined view of your opportunity data.

## How can I edit the values in "lost reason" field under Opportunities

Step 1: Go to Settings > Custom Fields  
Step 2: Select Lost Reason and click on Bulk Actions > Edit

Step 3:Make changes to your lost reason values in the modal and save for them to reflect. 

    If the name of the lost reason is changed for any of these instances, all the places where the lost reason was being invoked will start showing the new name for the same.
