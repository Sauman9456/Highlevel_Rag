  * You can use search filters or browse through the list of opportunities to find the specific one you need to update.
  * Click on the name or title of the opportunity to open its details page.

### **Step 3: Opening the Opportunity Details Page**

  * In the opportunity details page, you'll find fields containing information about the opportunity.
  * Update any relevant details such as the contact's name, contact information, opportunity value, and opportunity source. 
  * You can also modify pipeline stages, owners, tags, or any other custom fields associated with the opportunity.

### **Step 4: Adding Notes and Attachments**

  * If necessary, add new notes or additional information about the opportunity by clicking on the "Notes" option in the left sidebar.
  * All notes added here will also reflect in the corresponding contact's notes also. 

### **Step 5: Setting Tasks and Reminders**

  * If there are specific tasks or follow-up actions associated with the opportunity, set tasks and reminders as needed by opening it from the sidebar.
  * Assign tasks to yourself or team members, specifying due dates and priority levels.
  * Similarly, you can also add appointments in the same way.
  * Tasks and appointments added this way will also reflect on the contact's end.

**Step 6: Managing Pipeline Stages**

  * Adjust the pipeline stage of the opportunity to reflect its current status in the sales process.
  * Move the opportunity through different stages as it progresses towards closure, updating its status accordingly.

### **Step 7: Managing Opportunity Status**

  * Drag and drop the opportunity to any status as seen in the bottom to update it's status. 
  * Possible statuses for an opportunity are "Open", "Won", "Lost" and "Abandoned". Default status for a new opportunity is "Open".
  * Marking an opportunity lost also allows you to add a lost reason for the same.
