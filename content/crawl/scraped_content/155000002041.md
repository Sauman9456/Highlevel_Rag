# Deleting and Restoring Opportunities

Modified on: Thu, 28 Mar, 2024 at 8:35 AM

Deleting an opportunity removes it from the active pipeline. Once an opportunity is deleted, it is no longer visible in the active opportunities list, but its data is retained in the system and can be restored if needed for **upto 60 days**. This allows users to declutter their pipeline by removing outdated or irrelevant opportunities while preserving the option to recover them later if necessary.
