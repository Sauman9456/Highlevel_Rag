# **New Field: Valid WhatsApp**

A new field named "Valid WhatsApp" has been introduced at the contact level. This field provides crucial insights into the WhatsApp status of each contact.

## **Filter Options:**

Three filter options are available under the "Valid WhatsApp" column:

  1. Is Valid: Indicates that the contact's number is active on WhatsApp.
  2. Is InValid: Indicates that the contact's number is not available on WhatsApp.
  3. Is Not Validated: Signifies uncertainty about whether the contact's number is on WhatsApp or not.

# **How is the Valid WhatsApp field updated**

### **1\. When a Message is Successfully Delivered on WhatsApp**

When a message is successfully delivered, the system automatically marks the contact as "**Is Valid"**

### **2\. If a Message Fails to Deliver or Encounters Meta Issues:**

In cases where a message fails to deliver or encounters issues with Meta, the contact is marked as "Is InValid"

### **3\. When a Contact Initiates a WhatsApp Message:**

When a contact initiates a WhatsApp message, the status is updated to "Is Valid," ensuring real-time validation. This reflects that the contact has actively engaged via WhatsApp, confirming the validity of their number.

### **4\. If There is No Conversation Over WhatsApp:**

If there is no conversation over WhatsApp with a particular contact, the status remains in the "Not Validated" state until further interaction.
