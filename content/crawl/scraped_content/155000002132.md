In order to use our SMTP server, you need to use the SMTP credentials associated with your domain. 

Please note that the SMTP credentials are unique for each domain you add. If you want to check the list of currently added users, or add more users, you can easily do so by accessing your domain settings.

    Note: Since we does not host mailboxes, We do not offer support for POP or IMAP protocols

## **Where can I find my IMAP settings?**

**IMAP is used to retrieve messages, and SMTP is for sending data**.

    Note: Since we does not host mailboxes, We do not offer support for POP or IMAP protocols. In IMAP settings you cannot use the SMTP credentails.

You can find your IMAP in your email provider settings.

**Example:**

If you are using **Google** , you need to generate an app password in Google,

**Username** : Your Email address

**Password** : You app password  
**IMAP host:** imap.gmail.com  
**IMAP port:** 993

Here are the support pages of some of the email providers that will guide you on obtaining the IMAP hostnames:
