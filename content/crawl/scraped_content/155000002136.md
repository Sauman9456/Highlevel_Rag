# App Permissions in Client Portal: Enabling/Disabling a child app

Modified on: Fri, 22 Mar, 2024 at 10:16 AM

We are excited to introduce a new level of customization and control within the client portal through our latest feature: App Permissions. This update allows users to tailor their app permissions according to their specific needs and preferences, including the ability to choose their default page upon logging in.

## How to Customise App Permissions

### Accessing App Permissions

  * **Navigate to Client Portal Settings** : Log into your client portal and locate the settings menu. Here, you will find a new option titled "App Permissions."
  * **Select "App Permissions"** : Click on this option to view and modify your app permissions.  

### Enabling/Disabling Apps

  * **Review Available Apps** : Within the App Permissions section, you'll see a list of all available apps and features associated with your portal.
  * **Toggle Permissions** : Use the toggle switch next to each app to enable or disable it. Disabling an app will remove its functionality and visibility from your client portal interface.

###   
Setting Your Default Page

  * **Find the Default Page Option** : Within the same App Permissions area, look for the option to select your default page.
  * **Choose Your Preferred Page** : From the dropdown menu, select the page you wish your users to see immediately upon logging into the client portal.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I change my default page later?** A: Absolutely. You can revisit the App Permissions settings at any time to adjust your default page or make other modifications to your app permissions.

**Q: What happens if I disable a feature I frequently use by accident?** A: If you disable a feature accidentally, you can easily re-enable it by going back to the App Permissions settings and toggling the feature back on.
