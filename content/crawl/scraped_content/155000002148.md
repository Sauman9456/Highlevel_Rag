We're excited to introduce a new feature: **Offline Certificates**. This functionality allows you to send certificates manually to any contact, making it easier to manage certifications for testing purposes or for courses not hosted on HighLevel. Whether you're conducting offline training or wish to issue certificates for external courses, this feature offers a seamless way to acknowledge your learners' achievements.

### Step 1: Navigate to Certificates

  * Log in to your HighLevel account.
  * From the dashboard, select "Memberships" from the menu.

### Step 2: Choose or Create a Certificate Template

  * You have the option to select an existing certificate template or create a new one from scratch.  

### Step 3: Send the Certificate

  * Once you've chosen or created your certificate template, click on the "Send" button.
  * You'll be prompted to fill in details such as the instructor's name and the recipient's email. If the recipient is not already a contact, you can add them by selecting "Add New".
