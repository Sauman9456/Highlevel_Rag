If you're operating on the WhatsApp Business platform, you know how crucial it is to maintain professionalism and clarity in your interactions with customers. One key aspect of this is your display name, the first thing customers see when engaging with your business on WhatsApp. To ensure smooth communication and compliance with WhatsApp's policies, it's essential to understand and adhere to display name guidelines. Below, we've outlined these guidelines to help you create a display name that represents your business accurately and effectively.

# **Compliance with Policies**

Your display name should align with WhatsApp [Commerce](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/commerce-policy/?fbclid=IwAR18CbdCVq89fPh0naMLuf6qvICP2x0FZPSPUk2oZ_lUNf-qKgbo2hUZmHY) and [Business](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/?fbclid=IwAR0r5k_N1rCYnfK8yyCWUP3D88tVCR814x9UX-w5EIcu8ai8b8is8ilrAQY) policies. This means it should accurately represent your business without violating any regulations. 

An example for a shop that sells a variety of sporting goods:

**Accepted:** Sarah's Sporting Goods Shop

**Not accepted:** Sarah's Sporting Goods Shop - Guns department

# **Accurate representation of your business**

## A display name should represent:

  * A business or its service, product or department.
  * A test account or a demo account and it must maintain an association to the business
    * For example Fresh Produce Test

## A display name should not be:

  * ## 

A generic term
    * For example: Fashion
  * A generic geographic location
    * For example: New York
  * Appearing to have verification
    * For example: Official or verified shouldn't be in the name
  * Contain the name of a Meta product
    * For example: WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger

An organisation with a government affiliation needs the WhatsApp team's approval.
