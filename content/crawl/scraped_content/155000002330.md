## **Q: What happens if I try to use media that doesn't fit the guidelines?**

You'll likely encounter an error message, and your template may not be sent. Ensure your media adheres to [WhatsApps Template Guidelines](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/message-templates/guidelines/)

## **Q: Do I need approval before using WhatsApp message templates?**

Yes, all templates must go through an approval process with WhatsApp (Meta) to ensure they meet specific guidelines.

## **Q: What factors can lead to a template being rejected?**

Common reasons for rejection include:

  * Missing or incorrect variable formatting
  * Content violating [WhatsApp's Business or Commerce policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/overview/policy-enforcement/violations/)
  * Sensitive information requests (e.g., full payment card numbers)
  * Abusive or threatening language
  * Duplicating an existing template
