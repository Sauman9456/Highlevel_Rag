    The WhatsApp Business API client scales and crops uploaded profile photos to be a square with a max edge of 640px and max size of 5MB before uploading to our servers.
    
    Images with a height or width of less than 192px may cause issues when the resizing occurs, because of this, **an image size of 640x640 is recommended.**

## **How Customers View Your Profile:**

Customers can view your business profile by clicking your business's name or number in a conversation thread. This accessibility ensures that your customers always have the latest information about your business at their fingertips.

# **FAQs**

## **Q: Why is it important to update my WhatsApp Business profile picture?**

Your profile picture is the first visual impression customers get of your brand. Keeping it updated ensures that your business profile appears professional and reflects your brand identity accurately.

## **Q: What are the recommended dimensions and file size for my profile picture?**

Meta recommends using images that are a square with a maximum edge of 640px and a maximum file size of 5MB. Images with dimensions of 640x640 pixels are ideal to avoid any resizing issues.

## **Q. Why profile picture matters**

Your WhatsApp Business profile lets you add publicly viewable information about your company. These details include your business name and address, category, description, email address, and website. This comprehensive profile helps customers easily understand who you are and what you offer, fostering trust and encouraging engagement.
