# Pre-requisites for WhatsApp Setup

## Connect your Agency Stripe Account

Your agency Stripe account will be used to collect subscription payments for WhatsApp from your clients. You can connect your agency Stripe account to your agency by following this helpful article: [](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001171910-how-to-connect-stripe-to-your-agency-dashboard)[How to Connect Stripe to Agency.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001171910-how-to-connect-stripe-to-your-agency-dashboard)

Note: You can also [Direct Deploy WhatsApp](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001980-whatsapp-overview-sub-account-set-up-and-best-practices#Direct-Deployment-\(Skipping-Rebilling\)) if you do not have a Stripe connected. However, this will charge your agency Card on file, skipping the reselling feature.

## Setting Up Reselling

In the reselling tab of agency settings, you can offer WhatsApp and set your pricing for subaccounts. This allows you to charge your clients a markup while HighLevel bills you at a fixed rate. When a client wants to, they can then purchase WhatsApp at this marked-up price. Allowing you to recoup the HighLevel price we charge you and then make a profit every month.

## Facebook Business Account

When setting up WhatsApp within a subaccount, you'll need a Facebook Meta business account and a WhatsApp Business profile. Follow the prompts to link accounts and fill in business information. 

    You will need a [Facebook Account](https://www.facebook.com/signup) and a [Facebook Meta Business Account](https://business.facebook.com/). (Learn what a Meta Business Account is [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/meta-business-suite).)

We will also utilize a "WhatsApp Business Account" and a "WhatsApp Business Profile", if you do not have one, this is completely normal, the process outlined below will create one for you if you do not have one to select.

# How to use LC/Twillio Number to connect with WhatsApp business account

## **Question: I received an error message stating that the number is registered to an existing WhatsApp account. What should I do next?**

**Answer:**

This error usually occurs in two situations:

  1. **Active WhatsApp Account on Your Mobile Device:**  
If you currently have an active WhatsApp account on your mobile device, you need to delete that account to connect with the chat account. Follow these steps:
     * Open the WhatsApp app.
     * Navigate to Settings > Account > Delete my account.
     * _Note:_ After integration, you will not be able to use WhatsApp on your phone, and your previous conversation history and contacts will not be migrated

  2. **WhatsApp Number Connected to Another Provider:**  
If your WhatsApp number is linked to another provider, you need to create a new WABA account and migrate your number to the new WABA account

## **Question: I am getting Message Undeliverable error**

### **Answer:**

Reasons can include:

  * The recipient phone number is not a WhatsApp phone number.
  * Sending an authentication template to a WhatsApp user who has a +91 country calling code (India). Authentication templates currently cannot be sent to WhatsApp users in India.
  * The message was not delivered to create a high quality user experience. See [Per-User Marketing Template Message Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/send-message-templates#per-user-marketing-template-message-limits).
