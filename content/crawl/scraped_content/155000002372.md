### **Overview**

By connecting your Zoom account, you can generate dynamic meeting links, reducing the time spent for any manual actions. If you have selected Zoom as your meeting location in any calendar, upon a new booking, the system will automatically generate a unique Zoom link, which will be sent along with the calendar invite.

### **Prerequisites**

You need access to your Zoom account that you want to connect.

### **How to Connect Zoom?**

1\. From "My Profile" menu under Settings tab.

2\. From "Calendars" menu under Settings tab.

### **Limitation with Zoom Integration**

Each user can connect only one Zoom integration per subaccount, and the same Zoom integration cannot be connected across multiple subaccounts. For instance, if User A has already connected their Zoom integration in Subaccount A, they won't be able to link the same Zoom integration in Subaccount B.

* * *

### **FAQs**

Q: Which Calendars Support Dynamic Zoom Links?

A: Only Round Robin and Collective calendars support Zoom integration and generate new Zoom links for each appointment booked.  

Q: How to use Zoom with Other Calendar Types?

A: You can use Zoom with Event & Class Booking Calendars as well. For these calendars, you can manually generate a Zoom meeting link from Zoom and paste it in the calendar settings.

**Steps:**

  1. Generate the Zoom meeting link in Zoom.
  2. In calendar settings, select Custom as the meeting location.
  3. Paste the generated Zoom link.
