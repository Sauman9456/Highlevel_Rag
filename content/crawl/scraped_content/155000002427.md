# General Questions

## Why do I need to confirm my contacts have consented to hear from me while importing contacts?

Two main reasons why the consent from contacts is helpful while importing contacts:

  * **Protect Your Sending Reputation: I** mporting bulk contacts without proper consent can lead to higher bounce and spam rates, negatively impacting your sending reputation.
  * **Prevent Issues with Purchased or Rented Lists:  **Even if some lists claim to have opt-in consent, they may not be suitable for marketing communication tools. Contacts from purchased or rented sources are likely to bounce, unsubscribe, mark emails as spam, and may cause blocklistings.

## What are the different bulk actions that cannot be restored?

The following bulk actions cannot be restored:

  * Bulk Email
  * Bulk Email Verification
  * Bulk Update Contacts to Company
  * Bulk Tag Add
  * Bulk SMS
