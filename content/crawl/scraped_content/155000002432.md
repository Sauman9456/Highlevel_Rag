The new List View transforms how you can interact with your opportunities by providing a detailed, streamlined, and customizable view. Here’s what you can do with it:

## How to Access the List View:

  1. Go to Labs in your sub-account settings.

  2. Enable the "Opportunities List View" feature.
  3. Navigate to your Opportunities section and switch to the List View from the top right toggle.

## Feature List:

  * **Opportunities in a Listed View:** See all your opportunities organized in a clear, tabular format. This makes it easier to scan through and find the information you need quickly.  

  * **Sorting Across Fields:** Easily sort your opportunities by any field, allowing you to prioritize and manage them more effectively.  

  * **Customizable Fields:** Choose which fields you want to display in your list view. You can resize and rearrange the fields as well.  

  * **Full Feature Parity with Board View:** All the powerful features you use in the board view are available in the list view too. This includes advanced filters to narrow down your search and robust search functionality to quickly find specific opportunities.  

## Benefits of the List View

The List View offers several key advantages that can enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow:

  * **Enhanced Visibility:  **With more opportunities displayed in the same view, you can get a comprehensive look at your pipeline without having to switch between screens.
  * **Increased Customization:** Tailor your columns to display the information that matters most to you. This customization ensures that your view is always aligned with your specific needs and preferences.
  * **Improved Efficiency:** By enabling sorting, filtering, and exporting directly from the list view, you can manage your opportunities more efficiently, saving time and reducing the effort needed to perform routine tasks.  

**_**_Note: This feature is currently in Labs and can disrupt custom CSS/JS changes across all your Opportunity views. Request you to please get all your major changes done before the Live Date (tentatively 8th August 2025) to avoid any possible disruptions_**
