    Few Prerequisite for Ad Manager -   
      
    1. Selection of a pricing model from Agency view > Reselling is the first step in accessing Ad Manager. It is best to set the reselling offer of Ad Manager to sub-accounts before proceeding further.  
      
    2. Toggling ON/OFF Ad Manager for a sub-account will ensure the visibility of Ad Manager tab under sub-account > marketing. It is ON by default for all the sub-accounts once agency has opted for a pricing model.  
      
    3. Ad Manager can be enabled for the sub-account by the agency and for every user, it can be enabled from staff > permissions of Ad Manager.  

    4. In Ad Manager, the first step is to connect multiple Facebook page by logging into your Facebook account via LeadConnector App. Ad Manager allows connecting multiple Facebook pages.   

Under **Default Ad Manager** model, Ad Manager is creating child Business manager with Facebook page to maintain the ad campaign buying, conversion pixel data, audience and other assets. 

Under **Connect-Your-Own Meta Business Manager** model, user is asked to connect an already existing Ad account and the associated Business Manager will be connected with Ad Manager to use and publish ads.

**Ad Manager allows the agency to resell to the sub-account and generate commission from 0-15%. [Learn more about Permission and Pricing[here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002440-ad-manager-permission-and-pricing)]**

 There are 3 Steps in Ad Manager which are  

**1\. Choose the objective, placement and content**

  * Objective - The first step to building a Facebook Ads campaign is to choose a goal that's most important for your business/brand building. Depending on the goal you choose - Lead Generation or Website Traffic. The goal objective with Lead Generation is achieved using the Facebook form integration, the user can create their new forms or utilise the other forms. The other objective of Website Traffic allows drive visitors to the landing page url.
  * Special Ad Category - If you are running ad campaign for employment, housing, credit, politics and online gaming and gambling, they fall under the Special Ad category and specifying it during the ad creation process ensures compliance with local laws and regulations for smooth campaign review. 
    * Facebook's Special Ad Category has limited targeting options, including restrictions on the following audiences:
      * Lookalike audiences: These are not allowed for Special Ad Category ads. However, you can create a Lookalike audience outside of Facebook and upload it as a custom audience.
      * Saved audiences: These are not allowed for Special Ad Category ads.
      * Zip codes or postal codes: These are not allowed for Special Ad Category ads. If you select specific locations, they will include a minimum of a 15-mile or 25km radius.

      * Other restrictions for Special Ad Category ads include:
      * Age defaults to 18-65+ and can't be edited.
      * Gender includes all genders only and can't be edited.

  * Placement - The places where you can run your ads are called placements.Automatic placements enable us to get the best results available from across all default placements based on budget allocated and help control costs. Manual placements allows user to select the places where they would like to show the ads for brand safety and optimisation.  

  * Content - It allows the user to add the Primary text (recommended 125 characters), Headline (recommended 40 characters), Description (recommended 25 characters) and rich media of Image(s)/Video(s) (Image size is 30MB and video size is 1GB)  

**2. Budget, Geography and Optional settings**

Note - For the first month, there is limit of 3500$ per subaccount for ad campaign. It will gradually increase for each month.  

  * Geography - Campaign can be adjusted to run for specific location or can exclude a specific location in certain country/state.  

  * Optional Settings of Interest, Gender, Language and Age group- The user can add more specific setup for each option.
