## What is Automation Workflow?

Automation workflow refer to a series of defined, repeatable steps or processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion. Workflows can be sequential, with each step dependent on the completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously.

## Few of the benefits of using Automations

  * Increased Efficiency: Automating routine tasks speeds up processes and reduces the time employees spend on manual activities, allowing them to focus on more strategic work.
  * Consistency and Accuracy: Automation ensures tasks are performed consistently and accurately, reducing the risk of human error and improving the quality of outcomes.
  * Cost Savings: By reducing the need for manual intervention, businesses can lower labor costs and minimize operational expenses.
  * Scalability: Automated workflows can easily scale to handle increased volumes of work without requiring additional resources.

## Details

**Triggers** and **Actions** are the basic building blocks for workflows.

### Trigger
