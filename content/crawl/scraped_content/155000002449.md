The blog can be customized by visiting the blog name, clicking on the three-dot edit, and editing the blog site.  

  1. Go to Sites > Blogs
  2. In the list view of Blogs, click on the name of Blog.
  3. Once you open the Blog, it will show Edit the Blog Site button (beside the New Blog post option) and it will show the list of Blog Posts
  4. Once you click on Edit the Blog Site, it will open the Blog editor with all the elements and global sections 
  5. It will allow users to edit the layout, what shows in the blog list card, and the style of the blog post. 

  * Layout -
