#### **What is In app call for IVR?**

Previously, our IVR system only allowed calls to be routed to phone numbers. Now, we've added a feature that lets you route these IVR calls to either a staff member's mobile phone or their GHL app (both web and mobile versions).

#### **How to configure?**

  * Go to Settings -> My staff
  * Click on Edit and go to "Call & Voicemail Settings" section.
  * Select from a set of options in the "Default channel for IVR"
  * Web app - Receive IVR calls on GHL web app
  * Mobile app
  * My Phone number

Mobile app :  

Web app: 

#### **What are the supported channels?**

Currently a staff member can choose either of the below as the default mode of communication for IVR

  * Web app - Receive IVR calls on GHL web app
  * Mobile app - Receive IVR calls on GHL mobile app
  * Phone number - Recieve IVR calls on phone number

####   

#### **What happens if I want to choose multiple channels?**

Currently only a single option is given as a default channel. Staff member can only pick one channel. The ability to select multiple channels is not available right now.
