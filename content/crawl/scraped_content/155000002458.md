# How to manage developer user accounts?

Modified on: Tue, 21 May, 2024 at 1:43 PM

In this guide, we'll explain how to manage users within your developer account using our Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. This feature allows you to add users to your marketplace account and assign them appropriate roles with specific permissions.

##

    * Roles and Their Permissions:
    * Maximum allowed permissions for each role
  * Managing User Roles and Permissions
      * Adding Users
      * Editing User Permissions
      * Deleting Users

## **Understanding Roles and Permissions**

Our RBAC system categorises developer users into three roles: Owner, Admin, and User. Each role has a distinct set of permissions to ensure appropriate access levels within your developer account.

####   

### **Roles and Their Permissions:**

**Owner:**

  * **The initial user who signs up is designated as the Owner.**

  * **Only one Owner per account.**

  * **Full access to all features and settings.**

  * **Cannot transfer ownership.**

**Admin:**

  * **Similar to the Owner but cannot modify the Owner's details.**

  * **Can manage other Admins and Users.**

**User:**

  * **Restricted access compared to Admins and Owners.**

  * **Limited to certain actions as detailed below.**

**  
**

### **Maximum allowed permissions for each role:**

**Permission**| **Owner**| **Admin**| **User**  
---|---|---|---  
**View apps**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **Yes**  
**Create and manage apps**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **Yes**  
**Delete apps**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **No**  
**Submit for review**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **Yes**  
**View app earnings**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **No**  
**Create & manage users**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **No**  
**View app dashboard**| **Yes**| **Yes**| **Yes**  
  
**  
**

##   

## **Managing User Roles and Permissions**

#### **Adding Users:**

  * Navigate to Account > User Management  

  * Click on the Add User button.

## 

  * Enter the new user's details including their email and assign a role (Admin or User).

  * Adjust the permissions as needed by toggling the available options  

  * Click Submit to add the user.

  * The user will receive an email containing the activation link. After clicking the link, they will be prompted to set a password. Once the password is set, the developer account will be ready to use.  

#### **Editing User Permissions:**

  * #### **As an Owner or Admin, you can modify the permissions for any user (Admins cannot modify Owner details).**

  * **Navigate to the user's profile in the Users section and click on 'Edit User' from the menu options.**

  * **Adjust the permissions as needed by toggling the available options.**

  * **Click Save to apply changes.**

****

#### **Deleting Users:**

  * **To delete a user,  ****navigate to the user's profile in the Users section and click on 'Remove User' from the menu options.**

  * **Note****: Only Owners and Admins can delete users. Users cannot delete other users.**
