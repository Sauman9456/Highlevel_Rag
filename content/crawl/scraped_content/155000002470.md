## Overview

The "Wait" action in your automation workflow is designed to hold a contact for a specific amount of time, until a certain condition is met, or until the contact responds. This allows for a more controlled and timely interaction with your contacts.

## Action Name

Wait - Time Delay

## Action Description

The "Wait" action holds a contact for a specific time duration, until a specified condition exists, or until the contact replies. This action is essential for creating delays in your workflow to ensure actions occur at the most appropriate times.

## Welcoming a New Customer

When a new customer signs up on your company's registration page, it's an excellent opportunity to make a positive first impression. More customers mean more business, right?

Why not send them a warm welcome email to make them feel valued and happy about their decision?

This automation workflow ensures that a welcome email is sent to every new customer who signs up for your business. Here’s how it works:

**Trigger:** The automation initiates when a new contact is created.

**Wait:** Add a wait period to delay the email, allowing it to be sent a day after the sign-up instead of immediately.

**Send Email:** Send the customer a personalized welcome email, making them feel special and appreciated.
