# Action - If/Else

Modified on: Wed, 7 Aug, 2024 at 12:21 PM

## Overview

The "If/Else Condition" action in your automation workflow allows you to fork the contact's journey based on specific conditions. This is useful for creating personalized and dynamic workflows that adapt to your contact's behaviours.

## Action Name

If/Else Condition

## Action Description

The "If/Else Condition" action evaluates a specified condition and directs the contact down different branches based on whether the condition is met or not. This enables you to tailor subsequent actions according to the contact’s engagement or characteristics.

## Action Details

Value Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Action Name| The name you assign to this action for easy identification in your workflow.| Yes  
Condition| The specific condition that is evaluated (e.g., if an email was opened, if a form was submitted).| Yes  
Branches| The paths that the contact will take based on the condition's outcome (e.g., Yes, No).| Yes  

## Example: Follow-Up Based on Email Engagement

**Scenario:** Your business sends a promotional email to customers, and you want to follow up differently based on whether they opened the email or not.

**Solution using the "If/Else Condition" action** :

**Trigger:** The workflow starts when a promotional email is sent.

**Action 1:** If/Else Condition to check if the email was opened.

**Condition:** Email Event is Opened.

**Yes Branch:** If the email was opened, send a thank-you email with a special offer.

**No Branch:** If the email was not opened, resend the promotional email with a different subject line.

Steps to Implement:

Add the If/Else Condition action to your workflow after sending the promotional email.

Set the Condition to "Email Event is Opened".

Configure the Yes Branch to follow up with a thank-you email and a special offer.

Configure the No Branch to resend the promotional email with a different subject line.

This approach ensures that you engage customers based on their interaction with your initial email, making your follow-up more relevant and effective.
