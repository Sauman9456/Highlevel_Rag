## Example: Appointment Reminder SMS

**Scenario:** Your business wants to send multiple SMS reminders to customers who have scheduled appointments to ensure they remember and attend their appointments. This reduces the likelihood of no-shows and ensures better preparation for the appointment.

**Solution using the Multi-Stage Appointment Reminder SMS Automation:**

Trigger: The workflow starts when an appointment is scheduled.

Action 1: Wait until 24 hours before the appointment.

Action 2: Send an SMS reminder 24 hours before the appointment.

Action 3: Wait until 1 hour before the appointment.

Action 4: Send an SMS reminder 1 hour before the appointment.

Steps to Implement:

Trigger: Set the automation trigger to activate when an appointment is scheduled.

**Trigger Name:** Appointment

**Action 1:** Add a wait action for 24 hours before the appointment time.

**Wait Condition:** 24 Hours before the appointment

**Action 2:** Configure the first SMS reminder to be sent 24 hours before the appointment.

**SMS Action Name:** 24hr Reminder SMS

Message Content:

    Hi {{contact.first_name}},
    This is a reminder for your appointment tomorrow at {{appointment.start_time}}.
    Looking forward to seeing you!
    Regards,
    [Your Company Name]

**Action 3:** Add another wait action for 1 hour before the appointment time.

**Wait Condition:** 1 Hour before the appointment

**Action 4:** Configure the second SMS reminder to be sent 1 hour before the appointment.

**SMS Action Name:** 1hr Reminder SMS

Message Content:

    Hi {{contact.first_name}},
    This is a reminder for your appointment in an hour at {{appointment.start_time}}.
    See you soon!
    Regards,
    [Your Company Name]

**Outcome:** This automation ensures that customers receive timely reminders about their appointments, helping to reduce no-shows and ensuring they are well-prepared. The multi-stage reminders increase the likelihood that the customer will remember and attend the appointment, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of your scheduling system.
