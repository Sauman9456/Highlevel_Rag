## Example: Managing New Leads from a Calendar Appointment Funnel

**Scenario:** Your business wants to create an opportunity in the sales pipeline whenever a new lead comes in from the calendar appointment funnel. This ensures that every lead is tracked and managed properly through your sales process.

**Solution using the "Create or Update Opportunity" action:**

**Trigger:** The workflow starts when a new lead is generated from the calendar appointment funnel.

**Action 1:** Create Opportunity action to create a new opportunity in the pipeline.

**Steps to Implement:**

  * Add the Create Opportunity action to your workflow to be triggered when a new lead is generated.
  * Set the Action Name to "Create Opportunity".
  * Select the appropriate sales pipeline from the In Pipeline dropdown (e.g., "YOUR PROMOTION Pipeline").
  * Choose the initial stage for the opportunity from the In Pipeline Stage dropdown (e.g., "New Leads").
  * Set the Opportunity Name to something descriptive, such as "Deal 251 Opportunity".
  * Define the Opportunity Source to indicate where the lead came from, e.g., "Lead from Calendar Appointment Funnel".
  * Optionally, you can fill in the Lead Value if you have an estimated value for the lead.
  * Set the Status to "open".
  * Configure additional settings as needed:
  * Enable Allow Opportunity to Move to Any Previous Stage in Pipeline if you want the flexibility to move opportunities backward in the pipeline.
  * Enable Allow Duplicate Opportunities if your process allows for creating duplicate opportunities for similar leads.

**Outcome:** This automation ensures that every new lead from the calendar appointment funnel is automatically tracked as an opportunity in your sales pipeline. This helps in organising and managing your sales process effectively, ensuring no lead is overlooked.
