## Overview

The **Contact Changed Workflow Trigger** in Workflows allows you to automate actions when changes are made to a Contact Record such as:

  * Tags being added or removed
  * DND being activated or removed
  * Contact being assigned or reassigned to a user 
  * Custom fields being populated or changing to something specific

This allows for automated actions to be triggered when certain criteria are met, ensuring timely and relevant responses to contact activities or updates.

To add a Contact Changed Trigger, go to "Automations" > "Workflows" > click the "Create a Workflow" button at the top right of the screen. Then, click "Add New Trigger" and search for the "Contact Changed" trigger.

## Trigger Name

Contact Changed

## Trigger Description

The "Contact Changed" trigger initiates the workflow whenever there are changes in the contact's details. This trigger is specifically useful for monitoring changes in Tags, Assigned User, Do Not Disturb (DND) status, and Custom Fields.

## How to Configure

The details for configuring the "Contact Changed" trigger are as follows:

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger| The type of event that will initiate the workflow (e.g., Contact Changed).| Yes  
Workflow Trigger Name| A custom name assigned to the trigger for easy identification.| Yes  
Filters| Criteria used to narrow down the specific changes that will trigger the workflow (e.g., Tags, DND, Custom Fields).| No  

## Example: Automated Follow-Up When a Contact's Business Niche Changes

**Scenario:** Your business wants to automatically follow up with contacts when their business niche changes, as this might indicate a new opportunity for targeted marketing or sales efforts.

**Solution using the "Contact Changed" trigger:**

**Trigger:** Set the trigger to activate when a contact's business niche is updated.

**Action:** Send a personalized email or assign a sales representative to follow up with the contact.

**Steps to Implement:**

**Choose a Workflow Trigger:** Set the Workflow Trigger to "Contact Changed".

Name the trigger appropriately, e.g., "Business Niche Update".

**Configure Filters:**

Under Filters, select "Custom Field".

Choose the custom field related to the business niche (e.g., "Business Niche").

**Define Actions:**

Add an action to send a personalized follow-up email:

**Email Action Name:** Follow-Up Email

**From Name:** Your Company

**From Email:** yourcompany@example.com

**Subject:** "We Noticed a Change in Your Business Niche!"

**Email Body:**

    Hi {{contact.first_name}},

    We noticed that your business niche has been updated to {{contact.business_niche}}. We have some exciting offers and resources tailored specifically for your industry.

    Looking forward to assisting you!

    Best Regards,
    [Your Company Name]

Optionally, add an action to assign a sales representative to the contact for a more personalized follow-up.

**Outcome:** This automation ensures that any change in a contact's business niche triggers an immediate follow-up, allowing your business to respond swiftly to potential new opportunities and maintain relevant and personalized communication.
