## Overview

The "Workflow Trigger - Contact Tag" action is designed to initiate workflows based on the addition or removal of specific tags to or from contacts. This allows for automated actions to be triggered when a contact is tagged with or untagged from certain keywords, ensuring timely and relevant responses to changes in contact status or interests.

## Trigger Name

Contact Tag

## Trigger Description

The "Contact Tag" trigger activates the workflow whenever a specified tag is added to or removed from a contact. This is useful for managing follow-ups, segmenting contacts, and personalizing communication based on contact interests or actions.

## Trigger Details

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger| The type of event that will initiate the workflow. In this case, select "Contact Tag".| Yes  
Workflow Trigger Name| A custom name assigned to the trigger for easy identification in your workflow.| Yes  
Filters| Criteria used to specify which tag addition or removal will trigger the workflow (e.g., Tag Added: "interested").| No  

## How to Configure

To set up the "Contact Tag" trigger, follow these steps:

**Choose a Workflow Trigger:**

  * From the dropdown menu, select "**Contact Tag** " as the Workflow Trigger.
  * **Set the Workflow Trigger Name:**
  * Enter a name for your trigger in the "Workflow Trigger Name" field. This name should help you easily identify the trigger within your workflow, e.g., "Tag 'Interested' Added or Removed".
  * **Configure Filters:**
    * Click on "Add filters" to specify the criteria for the trigger.
    * Select "Tag Added" from the filter options and specify the tag that will trigger the workflow, e.g., "interested".
    * Click "Add filters" again to add another filter.
    * Select "Tag Removed" and specify the same tag, e.g., "interested".
  * **Define Actions for Tag Added:**
  * Add actions to be performed when the specified tag is added to a contact. For example:
  * Send a personalized follow-up email to the contact.
  * Notify a sales representative for further engagement.
  * **Define Actions for Tag Removed:**
  * Add actions to be performed when the specified tag is removed from a contact. For example:
  * Send a re-engagement email or survey to understand why the contact lost interest.
