# Gamification - Points, Badges and Leaderboard

Modified on: Thu, 23 May, 2024 at 4:22 AM

Welcome to the new Gamification and Leaderboard feature by Highlevel Community! The gamification features of community makes participating inside a group more fun and engaging. Point earning creates a progression system that encourages users to produce quality content and interact with other members of their community.

## **Setting up Gamification**

Gamification levels are **pre-defined.** Maximum levels are set to 9.

  * As a group admin, user can edit the Level Names. To do this, go to Settings > Gamification & Rewards > Gamification > Click to edit the relevant level name.
  * Make sure to hit the SAVE button.

## **How do levels and points work?  **

Points are earned when others like your posts, comments, and replies. 1 like = 1 point for the post or comment author.  

**Number of points required to reach a certain level:**

Level 1 - 

0 points

Level 2 - 

5 points

Level 3 - 

20 points

Level 4 - 

65 points

Level 5 - 

155 points

Level 6 - 

515 points

Level 7 - 

2015 points

Level 8 - 

8015 points

Level 9 - 

33015 points

**After reaching a level:**

  * **A member's profile badge will reflect their current level.**
  * **Users can accordingly see the points required to reach the next level**
  * **The circular progress bar is completed after a level is reached**

**Note that the member levels are at the group level. A member at level 3 will be at that level in that particular group. If they join another group, they will start at level 1, like all new members.**

**Leaderboard**

Users can also view leaderboards for the group they are currently in to see how their levels stacks up against other members. This will give a preview of which courses unlock at certain levels as well as the custom level names for each group.  
You can find members who earned the highest points in the past **7 days, 30 days, and overall.**  

**  
**

## **Rewards**

  * Rewards - Group admins/ owners can choose to add offline rewards as texts. Maximum 3 rewards can be added. Example - Win $50 after reaching level 5. 
  * To add a reward (as an admin), go to Settings > Gamification & Rewards > Rewards.
  * Once Rewards are added, they are reflected on the left nav bar inside the Leaderboard Tab.

_Note that rewards cannot be linked to any gamification level as of now. All rewards added need to be managed offline._
