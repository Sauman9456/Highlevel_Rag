## Overview

The "Workflow Trigger - Pipeline Stage Changed" trigger is designed to initiate workflows when the stage of an opportunity within a sales pipeline changes. This allows for automated actions to be triggered based on the progression or regression of opportunities through different stages of your sales process, ensuring timely and relevant follow-ups.

## Trigger Name

Pipeline Stage Changed

## Trigger Description

The "Pipeline Stage Changed" trigger activates the workflow whenever an opportunity moves to a different stage within the specified pipeline. This is useful for managing follow-ups, updating stakeholders, and automating tasks based on the movement of opportunities through your sales pipeline.

## How to Configure

To set up the "Pipeline Stage Changed" trigger, follow these steps:

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger| The type of event that will initiate the workflow. In this case, select "Pipeline Stage Changed".| Yes  
Workflow Trigger Name| A custom name assigned to the trigger for easy identification in your workflow.| Yes  
Filters| Criteria used to specify additional conditions for triggering the workflow (e.g., specific pipelines, stages).| No  

**Choose a Workflow Trigger:**

From the dropdown menu, select "Pipeline Stage Changed" as the Workflow Trigger.

Set the Workflow Trigger Name: Enter a name for your trigger in the "Workflow Trigger Name" field. This name should help you easily identify the trigger within your workflow, e.g., "Pipeline Stage Changed Follow-Up".

**Configure Filters (optional):**

Click on "Add filters" to specify additional criteria for the trigger.

You can filter by specific pipelines or stages to narrow down the conditions that will activate the workflow.

**Define Actions for Pipeline Stage Change:**

Add actions to be performed when an opportunity changes stages. For example:

Send a notification email to the sales representative.

Update the opportunity details or status.

Notify a manager or team about the stage change.

Trigger follow-up tasks or reminders based on the new stage.

##   

## Example: Ensure the opportunity changes are promptly addressed by your team

**Trigger Setup:**

**Workflow Trigger Name:** Pipeline Stage Changed Follow-Up

**Filters:** (Optional, if you want to filter by specific criteria like pipelines or stages)

Action for Pipeline Stage Change:
