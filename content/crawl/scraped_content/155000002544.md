# Sub-account | Managing User Roles & Permissions

Modified on: Thu, 30 May, 2024 at 1:17 PM

In this article, we discuss how you, as a sub-account admin, can granularly manage your users' permissions across various modules.

If you're here looking for Agency's user roles and permission management, [click here](https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/a/solutions/articles/155000002543?portalId=48000045315).

# Getting started with user permissions

To manage users' permissions for a sub-account, 

  * Navigate to Settings > My Staff.
  * Click on the edit icon for the user whose permissions you want to edit.
  * Click on 'Roles & Permissions' in the left menu.

# Restrict visibility to assigned data

For user role 'User', you may restrict the user's access to the records assigned to him/her only. For example, if you have two sales members in your team and do not want them to see each others' leads or contacts, you may select 'Only assigned data'.

# Assigning user role

Select whether the user is an admin or a user.

# Assigning permissions

Sub-account admins can apply granular permissions to their users. You may control the permissions at two levels:

  * Module: Toggle the module off to completely restrict access to the module.
  * Granular: Using checboxes, you can set the permissions at a granular level.

The new permissions structure is backward compatible with the old set of permission structures and their functionalities.

# Copy permissions

Sub-account admins can copy a user’s granular permissions to another user. For example, when Bob joins the sales team, the admin can clone Alex’s permissions to Bob.

# Note

With this foundational capability now launched, HighLevel will now start rolling out granular permissions across its various products. Stay tuned to this space for more advanced and granular permission controls.
