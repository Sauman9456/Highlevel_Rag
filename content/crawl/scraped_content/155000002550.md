## Overview

A workflow trigger initiates a series of automated actions when specific conditions are met. In this case, the trigger is set to activate when a form is submitted. This is useful for automating tasks such as data collection, notifications, and record updates, enhancing efficiency and ensuring timely responses.

## Trigger Name

Form Submitted

## Trigger Description

The "Form Submitted" trigger activates a workflow whenever a specified form is submitted. This trigger can be customized with filters to narrow down the specific forms or submission criteria that initiate the workflow, ensuring that only relevant data or actions are processed.

## How to Configure

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Choose a Workflow Trigger| Select "Form Submitted" from the dropdown.| Yes  
Workflow Trigger Name| Enter a name for your trigger, e.g., "Form Submitted."| Yes  
Filters| Specify conditions to narrow down the trigger, such as form name.| No  

**Step-by-Step Guide**

  * Navigate to Workflow Triggers: Access the automation or workflow settings in your platform.
  * Choose a Workflow Trigger: Select "Form Submitted" from the list of available triggers.
  * Name Your Trigger: Enter a descriptive name for the trigger, such as "Form Submitted."
  * Set Up Filters (Optional): Add filters to specify which forms will trigger the workflow. For example, you can filter by form name or other criteria.

## Example: Customer Information Collection

**Scenario:** A business wants to streamline the process of collecting and managing customer information through an online form.

**Trigger Setup:**

Trigger: Form Submitted

Name: Customer Information Form Submission

Filter: Form is "Customer Information"

Workflow Actions:

**Form Submitted:** Automatically enter the submitted data into the customer database.

**Internal Notification:** Send an email notification to the sales team with the new customer information.

**Create an opportunity** : Create a follow-up task in the CRM for a sales representative to contact the new customer.
