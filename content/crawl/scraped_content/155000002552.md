## Overview

A workflow trigger initiates automated actions when specific conditions are met. In this case, the trigger activates when a call reaches a certain status. This is particularly useful for managing follow-ups, notifications, and task assignments based on the outcomes of calls, ensuring timely and appropriate responses.

## Trigger Name

Call Status

## Trigger Description

The "Call Status" trigger activates a workflow whenever a call reaches a specified status, such as busy, no-answer, canceled, completed, or voicemail. This trigger can be customized with filters to narrow down specific call statuses that initiate the workflow, ensuring that only relevant call outcomes are processed.

## How to Configure

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Choose a Workflow Trigger| Select "Call Status" from the dropdown.| Yes  
Workflow Trigger Name| Enter a name for your trigger, e.g., "Call Status."| Yes  
Filters| Specify conditions to narrow down the trigger, such as call status.| No  

**Step-by-Step Guide**

  * Navigate to Workflow Triggers: Access the automation or workflow settings in your platform.
  * Choose a Workflow Trigger: Select "Call Status" from the list of available triggers.
  * Name Your Trigger: Enter a descriptive name for the trigger, such as "Call Status."
  * Set Up Filters (Optional): Add filters to specify which call statuses will trigger the workflow. For example, you can filter by statuses like busy and no-answer.

## Example: Missed Call Text Back

**Scenario:** A business wants to ensure that all missed calls (busy or no-answer) are promptly followed up to maximize customer engagement and support.

**Trigger Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Call Status
  * **Name:** Missed Call Follow-Up
  * **Filter:** Call Status is "busy" or "no-answer"

**Workflow Actions:**

  1. **Notification:** Send an email or SMS notification to the sales or support team about the missed call.
  2. **Task Creation:** Automatically create a follow-up task in the CRM for a team member to call back.
  3. **Log Entry:** Log the missed call details into the customer record for future reference.

**Outcome:** This automation ensures that all missed calls are addressed promptly, improving customer service and increasing the likelihood of successful follow-ups. This leads to higher customer satisfaction and potential sales opportunities that might otherwise be missed.
