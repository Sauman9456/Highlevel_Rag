# What is a Domain?

A domain serves as the digital address for online services like websites, email hosting, and more, by mapping them to IP addresses through DNS. Domain names are essential for your online presence, enhancing website accessibility and enabling email communication.

Domains are crucial for website hosting, white-label branding, configuring branded/API domains, email setup, and the Client portal. They form the foundation upon which HighLevel users build their digital presence.

## What are Root & Sub-Domains

When working with domains, it's important to distinguish between a root domain and a subdomain. 

  * **Root Domain  **(Example: “mywebsite.com”)

    * The root domain is the primary address of your website, appearing after "www." in a URL (e.g., in "www.mywebsite.com," the root domain is "mywebsite.com"). It serves as the main entry point to your website.

  * **Subdomain** (Example: "help.domain.com")

    * Subdomains are extensions of your root domain, directing users to specific sections or areas within your online infrastructure (e.g., "help.domain.com" for support). This allows for separate content, landing pages, and marketing campaigns without affecting the primary site. This setup is useful for ads, promotions, and utilizing different SEO strategies.

    **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Be careful when adding root domains. Many users accidentally break their existing mailbox or site by adding a root domain already in use. We recommend adding a sub-domain if your root domain is used somewhere else.

* * *

## Seamlessly Connect Domains with Domain Connect

**If your domain provider is Google, Cloudflare, or GoDaddy** , The system offers automatic DNS configuration for connecting your domain to the platform. This feature eliminates the need to manually manage DNS records for branded domains, websites, dedicated domains, and the client portal. Auto-configuration streamlines domain integration, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

To see more information about seamlessly connecting domains, please visit [](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000734-how-to-use-the-domain-connect-feature-)[How to Use the Domain Connect Feature](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000734-how-to-use-the-domain-connect-feature-)

### Manual Option

**If your domain provider is not Google, Cloudflare, or GoDaddy** , manual DNS configuration is required. The system simplifies this process by generating the necessary record values for you to input into your domain provider's system. This ensures seamless integration of your domain with HighLevel, supporting branded domains, websites/funnels, dedicated domains, and the client portal.

1) Now you open your DNS provider of choice and add the records in. Adding records are much the same, with some variation based on the provider. Go to your DNS manager and click add record.

2) Select the record type provided by HighLevel

3) Input the Hostname into the “Name” field and Value/Target into the “target field”

4) Save the record. If utilizing Cloudflare the Proxy Status will need to be toggled off.

# Places to Add Domains to in HighLevel

Within HighLevel, there are many places to add a domain, let’s briefly explore each one. We will provide resources to learn more.

## Whitelabel Domain

Whitelabeling your desktop web app ensures that your customers interact with your domain instead of the default one. Simply follow four steps: create a CNAME in your DNS records, configure it in your HighLevel Agency account, upload your agency logo, and update your agency Terms & Conditions. Once your DNS record propagates, your customers 

can access the app using your domain, seeing your branding elements like logo and terms & conditions.

    A sub-domain is Recommended for whitelabeling. Most Commonly agencies will use "app" as the sub-domain for their whitelabel desktop app.

_Navigate to the Agency View > Settings  > Company Settings > Whitelabel Domain_

For more information on setting up your Whitelabel Domain please visit [How to Set Up a Whitelabel Domain](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48000982207-how-to-set-up-a-whitelabel-domain-for-the-desktop-web-app)

## API or Branded Domain

Enhance your brand visibility and link deliverability by customizing system-generated links with our API/Branded Domains. By doing so, you can personalize links for forms, surveys, calendars, and more.

Custom API domains allow for branding of system-generated links, improving brand recognition and link deliverability. Configure API domains at the agency level company settings to establish a default branded domain for all sub-accounts.

_Navigate to the Agency View > Settings  > Company Settings > API Domain_

At the sub-account level to customize domains for individual clients a branded domain can be set up. This will be done under the sub-account settings, within the business profile.

_Navigate to the Sub-Account > Settings  > Business Profile > API Domain_

# Troubleshooting

If you've added DNS records to your domain provider but are encountering issues like web pages returning 404 errors, there are a few key troubleshooting steps to consider. 

1\. Check for Duplicate A Records:

2\. Confirm DNS Propagation

3\. Review DNS Settings for Accuracy:

4\. Verify Domain DNS Integration:

5\. Consider Other Potential Causes:

6\. Seek Additional Assistance:

## 1\. Check for Duplicate A Records:

  * Ensure there are no duplicate A records pointing to the root domain in your domain provider's configuration.

  * Look for records with "@" as the hostname, indicating a root domain A record.

  * If duplicate A records are found, correct them to avoid conflicts that might cause 404 errors.

  * Ensure each A record points to the correct data specified by HighLevel. “162.159.140.166”

## 2\. Confirm DNS Propagation

  * Verify whether the DNS changes have fully propagated across the internet.

  * DNS changes typically take between 24 to 48 hours to propagate, depending on factors like TTL, ISP, and domain provider systems.

  * Utilize a DNS checker tool (https://dnschecker.org/) to monitor propagation status and identify any incomplete updates.

## 3\. Review DNS Settings for Accuracy:

  * Double-check all DNS settings to ensure accuracy.

  * Confirm that each DNS record points to the appropriate HighLevel value.

## 4\. Verify Domain DNS Integration:

  * Ensure that the domain DNS records were correctly added to the provider where the domain Nameservers are pointing.

  * If the Nameservers are managed by a different provider, integrate the HighLevel records into the DNS of that provider.

  * Utilize a MX checker (https://mxtoolbox.com/) to verify the Hosting provider and that the records are propagating the correct data.

## 5\. Consider Other Potential Causes:

  * If the issue persists, explore other potential causes such as server downtime or incorrect domain configurations.

  * Investigate any recent changes or updates that might have impacted the DNS settings.

## 6\. Seek Additional Assistance:

  * If troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to your domain provider's support team for further assistance.

  * Alternatively, contact HighLevel support for specialized help in resolving DNS-related issues.

# FAQ

## What If I do not have a domain?

You can purchase a domain from a domain registrar such as Godaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, Google Domains if you do not currently own a domain. Once purchased this will allow you to proceed to set up the domain within HighLevel

## Can I use an existing domain for my email?

You can set up a dedicated domain for an existing domain. It is advised to utilize a sub-domain when setting up your domain for email sending within HighLevel to prevent it from affecting your current email services. 

## Can I use WIX for my Dedicated Domain?

Wix does not allow for multiple MX records to be added of the same priority. In order to use a domain that is connected to Wix the nameservers will need to be changed to point to another domain host. For more information please see: [LC Email / Mailgun replies not working when using WIX as the domain provider](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001188738-lc-email-mailgun-replies-not-working-when-using-wix-as-the-domain-provider)

## My Cname record is not being recognized in Cloudflare.

Make sure the Cname record that is added into Cloudflare has the proxy toggled off in order to allow the record to propagate. 

## What if I have an existing domain?

If you have an existing domain, Great! If you currently have an existing website connected to that domain and are not wanting to replace it with a HighLevel website/funnel we can utilize a sub-domain to connect your domain to our funnels so that we could get this to act independently
