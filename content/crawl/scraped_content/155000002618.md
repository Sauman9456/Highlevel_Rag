## Overview

The "Abandoned Checkout" trigger initiates a workflow when a customer leaves items in their shopping cart without completing the purchase. This trigger helps businesses re-engage potential customers and recover lost sales by automating follow-up actions based on specific conditions. 

###   

## Trigger Name

**Abandoned Checkout**

###   

## Trigger Description

The "Abandoned Checkout" trigger activates a workflow whenever a customer abandons their shopping cart. This can be customized with filters such as the duration of abandonment and the cart value to ensure targeted follow-up actions are initiated only for significant opportunities.

This trigger allows businesses to automate follow-up actions, such as sending reminder emails or SMS messages, to encourage customers to return and finalize their transactions. By effectively managing abandoned checkouts, businesses can increase conversion rates and recover potentially lost sales.

### How to Configure

####   

#### **Step-b****y-Step Guide**

    1. **Navigate to Workflow Triggers:** Access the automation or workflow settings in your platform.
    2. **Choose a Workflow Trigger:** Select "Abandoned Checkout" from the list of available triggers.
    3. **Name Your Trigger:** Enter a descriptive name for the trigger, such as "Abandoned Checkout."
    4. **Enter Duration:  **Add the duration after which you want the workflow to trigger. For eg. if duration is 60 minutes then the workflow will trigger after 1 hour when the product is added to the cart and purchase is not made.
    5. **Set Up Filters (Optional):** Add filters to specify conditions for the trigger such as the cart value or any other custom fields.

## Real-Life Business Example

**Recovering Abandoned Cart Sales**

**Scenario:** An online retailer wants to re-engage customers who have abandoned their shopping carts with high-value items, aiming to recover lost sales.

**Trigger Setup:**

    * **Trigger:** Abandoned Checkout
    * **Name:** Abandoned Checkout
    * **Filters:**
      * **Duration (minutes):** 10 (trigger the workflow if the cart is abandoned for more than 10 minutes)
      * **Cart Value:** Greater than 50 (trigger the workflow only if the cart value exceeds $50)

**Workflow Actions:**

    1. **Email Notification:** Send a personalized email to the customer, reminding them of the items left in their cart and offering an incentive (e.g., discount).
    2. **Follow-Up SMS:** Send a follow-up SMS to the customer with a reminder and a link to their cart.
    3. **Internal Notification:** Notify the sales team about the abandoned cart to allow for personalized follow-up.

**Outcome:** This automation helps recover potentially lost sales by re-engaging customers who abandoned their carts with valuable items. The targeted follow-up actions increase the likelihood of conversion, improving the overall sales performance.
