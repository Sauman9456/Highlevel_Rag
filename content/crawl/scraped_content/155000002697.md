# Appointment scenarios in Workflow

Modified on: Wed, 26 Jun, 2024 at 8:12 AM

There can be multiple scenarios when a customer is booking an appointment.In this document outlines the scenarios, how the workflow will behave in each case and what will be the contact's journey.

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * Scenario 1 - Re-entry of a contact in workflows
  * Scenario 2 - Appointment cancellation
  * Scenario 3 - Reschedule to a later date
  * Scenario 4 - Recurring appointments

### **Scenario 1 - Re-entry of a contact when appointment is booked**

A customer can book multiple appointments at once. For Appointment trigger contact can enter workflow multiple times even if the contact is already present in the workflow.

A contact can book multiple appointments so the contact should be able to enter the workflow multiple times irrespective of Allow Re-entry or it being already present in the workflow.

For the remaining scenarios we will be using the below mentioned example

### **Scenario 2 - Appointment cancellation**

**Example:**

  * **Current Date:** June 20
  * **Appointment Date:** June 25
  * **Workflow Step:** The contact is at the "Wait for 5 days" step.

**Change:** The customer cancels the appointment.

**When the appointment is treated as "Cancelled"  **\- If the appointment status is changed from New/Confirmed/Show to Cancel/Invalid/No Show then the appointment is treated as "Cancelled"

**Result:** The customer will be pulled out of the workflow, and no further actions will occur.

**Why -  **As the contact has cancelled the appointment no further actions should be performed.

### **Scenario 3 - Reschedule to a later date**

**Example:**

  * **Current Date:** June 20
  * **Original Appointment Date:** June 25
  * **New Appointment Date:** June 30
  * **Workflow Step:** The contact is at the "Wait for 5 days" step.

**Change:** The customer reschedules the appointment to June 30.

**When the appointment is treated as "Rescheduled"  **\- When there are changes in the "Start time" and "End time" of an appointment then it is treated as "Rescheduled"

**Result:** The customer will be pulled out of the workflow and based on the appropriate trigger it will re-enter the workflow.

**Why** \- As the appointment has been rescheduled the contact should receive all the relevant communication based on the rescheduled time.

### **Scenario 4 - Recurring appointments**

**Explanation:** Recurring appointments will not trigger entry through the "Customer Booked Appointment" trigger.
