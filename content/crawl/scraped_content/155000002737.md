# Prospecting Tool: Create Prospecting Widgets For Your Websites

Modified on: Thu, 11 Jul, 2024 at 10:55 AM

    **IMPORTANT:** This feature is only available after upgrading to the paid version of the prospecting tool inside of your HighLevel agency account.

We have created a new Prospecting Tool Widget that helps agencies generate leads easily. Visitors to your website can fill in their business information and receive insights about their listings, reviews, website performance, SEO, and more. The details of these leads will be visible in the prospect dashboard, allowing agencies to connect with them and convert them into successful clients. This guide will walk you through the steps to create and embed the widget into your website.
