**Q: Why am I receiving a delivery incomplete error email from Gmail when I use a BCC address while sending emails from my 2-way sync email?    **

**A:  **** ** You may receive a "Delivery incomplete" error from Gmail when using BCC addresses. Despite the error, your email might still be successfully posted to the CRM. This occurs because we use BCC for logging purposes, and Gmail doesn't get a delivery receipt for this BCC address. So, though the email is logged successfully you might receive the error email.

**Q: Why am I unable to send Instagram DMs to people who are commenting on my instagram posts?  **

**A:  **** ** For a business to**** ** send a DM to a contact, the contact has to send at-least one DM within last 24 hours. To reply to comments, use "**Instagram Interactive Messenger** " action from workflows and set the reply type as "**Reply to comment via DM** ".**
