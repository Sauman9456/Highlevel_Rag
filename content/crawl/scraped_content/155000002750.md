**How to use it?**  
  
**Step 1:  **Upload the video to the desired frame  
**Step 2:  **Pause the video at the preferred frame and click on "Use current frame as thumbnail"

**Step 3:  **After clicking on "Use current frame as thumbnail" the thumbnail will appear on lesson thumbnail

**Step 4:  **Click on save to confirm your thumbnail

After it is saved it will appear as the thumbnail image for both Lesson and Video, like so:

    Note: If you want to change the thumbnail again, you can follow the process from step 1. If you wish to add lesson thumbnail different to a video thumbnail you can upload it manually.
