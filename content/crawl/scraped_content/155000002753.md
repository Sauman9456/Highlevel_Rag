2\. Connect your Pinterest account (ensure you are an admin of the account).

3\.   Create a new post using the social planner post composer.  
4\. Select the Pinterest account along with your other social accounts.  
5\. You will be prompted to select the Pinterest board.  
6\. If you do not have any boards, you can create one using the "Add board" option in the board selection dropdown.  
\- The locked icon is private board  
\- The public board will not have the locked icon  
\- User can create new board  

Pinterest Requirements:
