# Multi Select for Forms, Surveys, Contains Phrase and Exact Match

Modified on: Mon, 8 Jul, 2024 at 4:38 PM

As there was no multi select functionality and users were not able to select the same filters again they had to create multiple triggers.

## **New functionality**

  * Now users will be able to select multiple options in Forms, Surveys, Contains Phrase and Exact Match fields.
  * This will work as an "Or" functionality. For eg. if in FB - Comments on a Post trigger, contains phrase field 5 options are present then the trigger will execute if the contact has commented any one of the phrases.

## **How to use?**

  * Forms & Surveys- In the trigger the ability to select multiple options by clicking on them from the dropdown will be available for filters.
  * Contains Phrase & Exact Match - In the trigger the ability to select multiple options will be available by pressing "Enter" or "Return" after typing the text.
