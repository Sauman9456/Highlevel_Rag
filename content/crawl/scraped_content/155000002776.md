We're thrilled to unveil a brand-new feature in Blog : Go to any funnel step or website page add the element of Blog Post, there is option to add new blog with different sorting options.

Prerequisite - New Blog should be added with domain and blog posts. [Help Article - How to create New Blog ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002448-how-to-create-a-blog-\))

How Does It Work?

1\. Navigate to Sites > Go to Funnels step or Website Page

2\. Add the element of Blog Post and drag and drop it out.

3\. With the blog post element, select the blog name

Note - if you are using the old blog flow, use the default blog site option to use it.

4\. Filter by the blog post - Recent Post, Recent Post by Category and Recent Post by Author and select the category/author.

Note - Filtering will apply on updated date (date when blog post is published)
