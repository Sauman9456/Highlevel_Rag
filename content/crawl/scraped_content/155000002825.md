# How to Add Product Weights, Dimension, and SKU Information in Your Ecom Store

Modified on: Mon, 15 Jul, 2024 at 4:32 PM

Store owners can add more information for their products: Weight, Dimensions, and SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). These fields are essential for future shipping integrations. We have added a new page for variants/ prices, where users can define product weights, dimensions & SKU details, including the ability of tracking inventory for the specific variants.

## **How to use:**

  1. To add these details, store owners can access it from: 

Payments > Products > Create Product > Add Pricing/ Variants > Pricing/ Variant page

.
  2. Initially, users must create a price or variant to access the respective page via the hyperlink in Product name.
  3. A "New" tag will appear for newly added unsaved prices, and the price/ variant page will be available only after saving the changes.
  4. In addition to tracking inventory, users can add product weights, dimensions, and SKUs within the variants or pricing page.
