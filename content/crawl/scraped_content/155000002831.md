# Know Your Customer (KYC) in the United Kingdom

Modified on: Thu, 18 Jul, 2024 at 1:17 AM

# What is Know Your Customer (KYC)?

If you have built an A2P communications solution, you will be familiar with Know Your Customer (KYC) data. Originating from the banking industry, KYC is essentially customer information that is required to identify and verify an individual or business is who they say they are and commonly consists of name, address, and date of birth for Individuals and company name, registered address, business verification documents, etc for businesses. Over the past decade, carriers and regulators around the world have been working hard to create a more trusted and verified messaging and voice ecosystem for businesses to engage with consumers to protect consumers from spam, fraud, and bad actors.

The first step the global communications industry is taking to protect consumers is requiring businesses and organizations to submit their KYC information and become verified by the local authorities before they can begin texting or calling their customers. Currently, not all countries require KYC information, but as the communications industry evolves it is becoming more common.

# KYC Requirements in the United Kingdom

Given the rise in scam and fraud over the last few years, the UK regulator issued updated Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines.

These new requirements will be put in place to protect consumers from fraud, spam, and bad actors by requiring businesses to submit and verify their businesses.

#### Here are the timelines to note:

  * **Starting May 27, 2024  **all new Long Codes purchases will require an approved Regulatory Compliance (RC) bundle before buying.
  * **Starting July 30, 2024  **SMS Sent from International Long Codes to the UK Will Be Blocked.  

  *  **Starting September 30, 2024  **all new and existing UK long codes must be connected to an approved UK RC bundle to be able to send messages or make voice calls.  
  
This regulation is only applicable for the UK Long Codes which include local, national, mobile, and toll-free phone numbers.

What you need to do?

**Follow these steps if you're a console user:**

1\. Prepare for the change in requirements and start collecting the required information and documents on your end.

2\. Start submitting the KYC information through the GHL console.  

3\. Once you submit the RC bundles, GHL will review the details and approve or reject the bundles.

4\. If your bundle is rejected, GHL will share reject reason, please understand the reason and resubmit with the appropriate information and get your bundle approved.

5\. If you have any new UK long code purchases coming up after May 27, 2024, please get your RC bundle approved proactively to avoid disruption to your services.

6\. After May 27, 2024, if you buy a new UK long code, you will be required to connect an approved bundle before buying.  

7\. All UK long codes which were purchased before May 27, 2024 will need to be attached to an approved RC bundle by September 30, 2024 to avoid service interruptions, we would encourage you to proactively connect all your long codes to approved RC bundles after May 27, 2024.

****Frequently Asked Questions:**

**Will there be any fees for registering my UK long codes?**  
No, there is no fees to register UK long codes

**I am an individual customer and I don’t have the required identity or address document, what do I do?**  
Unfortunately, you will not be able to use GHL’s UK long codes without proper documentation

**I am a business customer and I don’t have the company documents, what do I do?**

**My business is not registered in the UK, which long codes am I eligible to use?**  
You should use UK Mobile or UK Toll Free numbers

**My business is not registered, what do i do?**  
We encourage you to register your business.

**I have multiple RC bundles and many numbers, what logic should I use to assign phone numbers to RC bundles?**  
You should not have duplicate RC bundles, each RC bundle should have unique details. Assign the RC bundles to the Phone number that align with the bundle details. Ex: a phone number used from the London office, so the appropriate RC bundle should be assigned.

Unfortunately GHL customers will not be able to buy new UK Longcodes without an approved UK RC bundle after May 27, 2024,. Existing numbers purchased before 27 May which do not have a KYC bundle by 30th September will have all traffic blocked.
