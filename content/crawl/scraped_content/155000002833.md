# How to Sell Your Subscription Based Services & Recurring Products in Your GHL Ecom Store

Modified on: Wed, 17 Jul, 2024 at 2:40 PM

Store owners can now sell their subscription based services or recurring products in their Ecommerce stores. Many store owners had this pain point of selling subscription based items in their stores and charge user on a billing cycle. This change will help users improve their month on month sales and improve their recurring revenue.

## **How to use:**

  1. Navigate to your products (

Payments -> Products

)
  2. Edit/add a new product with a recurring price, and most importantly, enable the

 "Include in online store"

 toggle.
  3. Important:

 Navigate to your store in the page builder, you will now see some minor changes in the UI, i.e support for recurring products. Customize the pill colors and pill text colors as per your liking.
  4. Upon saving and publishing all pages, you can see recurring products being supported on our Ecommerce stores

### **Note:  **

Please save and publish all store pages, whether or not you customize the pill colors, this is important for the styles to look like how it looks on builder. If you don't save and publish, the live site will look different from the builder.
