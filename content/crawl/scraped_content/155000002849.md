We are excited to introduce new features for community groups: Private Channels and Channel Emojis. These features are available on both mobile and Web version, enhances privacy and customization options for your community.  

### **New Features**  

#### **Private Channels:**

One of the most awaited features is here. You can now create private channels within community groups to keep certain content private. Group admins and owners can create new private channels or convert existing public channels to private.

     * Create a new channel.
     * Toggle the switch to make the channel private.  

  2. **Convert an Existing Channel to Private:**

     * Open the channel settings.  

     * Go to the settings tab.  

     * Click on "Change to Private Channel."  

  3. **Add Members to a Private Channel:**

     * Open the channel settings again.  

     * Go to the members tab.  

     * Add members to the channel.  

     * You can assign a member as a channel manager, giving them admin access to that specific channel.  

##### **Things to Note:**

  * The group owner and channel creator are automatically added as channel managers.
  * A channel manager acts as an admin for that specific channel. Group roles like owner and group admin do not have significance within a private channel.
  * The group owner cannot leave a private channel.
  * Private channels will not be visible in the channel list to users who are not part of them.  

#### **Channel Emojis**

You can now add emojis as channel icons. This feature allows you to customize your channel icons, making them more fun and visually distinct.
