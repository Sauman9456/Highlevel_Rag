## **Overview**

The new IP Protected Snapshots feature allows you to share snapshots with enhanced protection for your intellectual property (IP). This feature ensures that your valuable assets cannot be easily re-shared or duplicated by others.

##   

## **Why Use IP Protected Snapshots?**

Many customers invest significant time and effort into creating complex assets such as workflows and funnels in their sub-accounts. These assets are often sold offline through snapshots. However, there have been instances where customers re-sell these assets by creating new snapshots from sub-accounts, which undermines the value of the original creator's work. IP Protected Snapshots address this issue by preventing unauthorized duplication and re-sharing of your assets.

## **How to created IP Protected Snapshots**

### Step 1 : New Snapshot Share Modal

**Enable IP Protection:** A new option in the Snapshot Share Modal allows you to enable IP protection when generating a new share link. This ensures that the assets in your snapshot cannot be re-shared or duplicated.

### Step 2 : Share the link with IP Protection Enabled

## **Trying to snapshot a sub account   created with IP Protected assets**

**Asset List:** The modal displays a list of all assets that will be included in the snapshot.

**Restricted Assets:** It also highlights any assets that are IP protected within the sub-account and will not be included in the snapshot.

## **How to Use IP Protected Snapshots**

### Generating a Snapshot Share Link

  1. **Access Snapshot Share Modal:** Navigate to the Snapshot Share Modal in your HighLevel account.
  2. **Enable IP Protection:** Click on the checkbox labeled "Enable IP Protection.
  3. **Generate Share Link:** Proceed to generate the share link with IP protection enabled.

### Creating a snapshot from a sub-account which was created with IP protected assets

  1. **Access Snapshot Create Modal:** Navigate to the Snapshot Create Modal in your HighLevel account.
  2. **Review Asset List:** Check the list of assets that will be part of the snapshot.
  3. **Identify Restricted Assets:** Note any assets marked as "Restricted (IP Protected)" that will not be included in the snapshot.
  4. **Create Snapshot:** Proceed to create the snapshot with the desired assets.
