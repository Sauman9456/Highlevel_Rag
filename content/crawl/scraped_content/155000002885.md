# How to Ban Members and Report Content in Communities

Modified on: Thu, 25 Jul, 2024 at 3:53 PM

## **New Features:**

  1. Ban members

 Now members can be banned from a group by the group Admins and Owners. And the banned member will be removed from the group and banned from joining the group again, revoking their abilities to perform any tasks that a regular member of the group can.
  2. Report content

 Any post or comment can now be reported by users. Group Admins can access the reported content list and decide wether to keep or remove the reported post/comment and take action on it.

Group admins will also receive Email, in app notifications and push notifications, for any content that is reported.

## **Here's how to access these Features:**

### **Ban members (On Web)**

  * Go to members tab
  * Click on "More options icon" (or ellipsis icon) of the user which you want to Ban and then click on "Ban from group"

  * Click on "Manage" button
  * And then click on Members from communities settings page
  * Click on "More options icon" (or ellipsis icon) of the user which you want to Ban and then click on "Ban from group"

### **Access Reported Content (On Web)**

  * On communities homepage, click on Settings and then choose the "Reported content" Tab.
  * It will list the reported content if any, with "Keep" and "Remove" options for you to take appropriate action.

### **Access Reported Content (On Mobile)**

  * On the communities Homepage, If you are admin, you should see a "Manage" button.
  * Click on "Manage" button
