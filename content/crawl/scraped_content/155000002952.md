# How to Easily Replicate Documents and Contracts Setup Across Different Accounts

Modified on: Wed, 31 Jul, 2024 at 9:15 PM

Documents and Contracts are now supported in Snapshots! 

Now, agencies can effortlessly save time during onboarding and ensure consistent Document templates across multiple locations.

How It Works:

  * Navigate to Account Snapshots in Agency View.
  * Create a new snapshot and choose the source account.
  * Save the snapshot.
  * Load the snapshot into the desired sub-account
  * Select all the Document Templates you want to load into the desired location

Why it Matters:

  * This feature streamlines the onboarding process for agencies, allowing them to easily replicate Document and Contracts setup across different accounts. With pre-configured document templates, agencies can ensure a consistent user experience and quickly provide basic templates to their clients.
