# How to Manage and Create Templates from the Admin Screen

Modified on: Thu, 1 Aug, 2024 at 2:04 PM

Introducing better template management feature in our Template Library for Agency admins.

Problem Statement: Previously, admins navigated through multiple subaccounts to import required templates, which was time-consuming.

? 

What we did:

  * Direct Create: 

Templates can now be imported/ created directly from the Admin screen.
  * Streamlined Process:

 Choose sub-accounts, preview templates, and rename them seamlessly.

⭐ 

Benefits:

  * Efficiency:

 Saves time by consolidating template management into one screen.
  * Simplified Workflow:

 Eliminates complexity across screens and sub-accounts.

?

 How It Works:

  1. \- Navigate to Template Library - Admin.
  2. \- Click "Create" at the top right.

  3. \- Choose the sub-account, product, and template name.

  4. \- Click "Continue" to preview the template thumbnail. Click on the thumbnail to see the entire preview in a different screen

  5. \- Rename the template if needed.

  6. \- Click "Create" to finalize.
  7. \- Update details like description and categories.

  8. \- Choose to Publish or Save as draft.
