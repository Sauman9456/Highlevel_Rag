# How to Add Recurring Products to Your Products List in Documents and Contracts

Modified on: Fri, 2 Aug, 2024 at 10:28 AM

What's new?

  * You can now add recurring products to your product list in Document Builder

  * If your product has a set up fee associated, it would show up as a separate row item

  * If you add a one time product and recurring product together in the list, the one time product will only be charged to the user in the first invoice.
  * You can also add a recurring schedule to your Document templates 

with capability to assign start date as the completed date of the document.

How to use?

  * Add a product list to your document

  * Add recurring as well as one time products in the product list
  * If a recurring product is added, add a schedule from the product list properties and set invoice sending date as document completed date or a custom date. (Enabled in templates as well)
  * Once the document is completed, an invoice will be sent (recurring if at least 1 recurring product was added, One time if none was added)
  * Set up fee associated with a product is shown separately in the product list

Why did we build it?

  * In our effort to streamline acceptance of invoices after Document Signature, recurring products and set up fee of products were stopping a lot of you from using contracts. No longer.

What's next on Payments via Documents and Contracts

  * 2 In 1 Documents: Showing invoice directly after primary signer signs the document
  * One time Deposit: Collecting a %age of the total product value in the invoice
