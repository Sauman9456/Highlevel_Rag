Modified on: Wed, 7 Aug, 2024 at 10:42 AM

Arrangement of products within the Product list page was an issue. Buyers always faced issue with the discoverability of products and as a store owner this was a bottleneck. To tackle this problem, store owners can now add the sort and filter option in the product list page.

## **How to use:**

  1. Navigate to the product list page, and select the product list element. There would now be 2 toggles to enable Sorting and Filtering. Enable them to add Sort & Filter elements to your Product List page.
  2. Configure properties for the sort and Filter. Some of the properties that can be configured are:

  * Sort and filter text color
  * Sort and filter pill color
  * Reset button color

  3. Click on save/Publish to view your changes in your site!
