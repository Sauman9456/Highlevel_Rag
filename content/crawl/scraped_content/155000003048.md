# How to Use Service Calendars in the Mobile App

Modified on: Wed, 7 Aug, 2024 at 2:40 PM

We're thrilled to announce our latest update to our Mobile Apps - The introduction of Service Calendars. Sub-account admins and users will now be able to access all their service appointments inside the calendar section as well as create a new service appointment with any of their contacts. This update is available on HighLevel, LeadConnector, and White-labelled (update needs to be requested) mobile apps.

  2. Create new service calendar appointments

## **How It Works**

  1. Open the mobile app with your preferred sub-account selected.
  2. Head over to the calendars section. You will see all your service appointments under their relevant dates.
  3. To create a new service appointment, tap on the "+" button and tap on Schedule appointment.
  4. From the calendar dropdown, choose a service calendar that you have created on web.
  5. You will then have to select the relevant room for the service. Once the room has been selected, equipment will automatically be assigned based on availability.

This update finally allows users to view and create service appointments from the mobile app.
