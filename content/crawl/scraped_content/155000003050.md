# Campaign budget definition: Connect-Your-Own Meta Business Manager

Modified on: Mon, 12 Aug, 2024 at 12:18 PM

In this article, we will be discussing about the budget definition process for an ad campaign in the Connect-Your-Own Meta Business Manager flow.

* * *

## **Understanding your campaign budget**

Campaign budgets for Facebook Ad campaigns are defined in the second step of the campaign setup flow. Once you enter the average amount that you want to spend on this ad campaign by selecting either daily or lifetime budget and launch your campaign, the amount specified will be charged from the card added to your connected Meta Ad account.

    **Note:  **The currency and timezone which is used by the location will automatically be reflected for the budget definition.

## **Setting daily budget**

When you define your daily budget, it refers to the daily average amount you wish to use to run this ad campaign. It means that on one day it could be more than defined and on other days it could be less than specified for a period of one week. The start date and time for this campaign will be the instance you publish the campaign on Ad Manager and the ad campaign is sent to Facebook for review.

Example: If you have specified your daily budget to be $1000, on one day Facebook might use $1100 as the campaign running cost and on other days of the weekly billing cycle it could be less than $1000. 

In no way possible, the ad expense charged to you will exceed $7000. To have a detailed understanding on how Daily Budget works in Facebook, refer:

### **How to set daily budget for a campaign:**

## **Setting lifetime budget**

Lifetime budget refers to the amount user is willing to spend over the entire period of an ad campaign. It can be useful if you don't want to exceed a certain amount of overall spend, and work best if you have flexibility on how much you want to spend each day.
