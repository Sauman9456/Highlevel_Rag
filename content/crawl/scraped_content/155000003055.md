# What happens when you delete a contact linked to a community group

Modified on: Tue, 27 Aug, 2024 at 5:39 AM

**When a contact is a group member**

  * When a contact is deleted from a community, the individual will be permanently removed from the community, losing all access to its content and features. 
  * This means the person will no longer be able to view any posts, updates, or discussions within the community, nor will they be able to participate by posting or interacting in any way. 
  * **T he deletion is irreversible**, effectively cutting off the individual from all community activities and communications.

**When a contact is a group owner**

  * It’s important to note that if the person in question is the owner of any group or location within the community, they cannot be deleted. 
  * The ownership status of a group or location grants them a level of authority and control that prevents their removal, ensuring the continuity and management of those specific areas within the community. 
  * As a result, any attempt to delete such a person would be blocked, preserving their access and responsibilities related to the groups or locations they oversee.  

1\. We can see the owner on the community while logging in to the community.  

2\. To see rest of the members, click on to the members tab inside the community page

3\. To see the admins of the community, click on the admins tab after selecting members.
