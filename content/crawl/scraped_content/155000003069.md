# FAQs

## What are Snippets?

Answer: Snippets are pre-defined blocks of text or multimedia content that you can create and save for quick and consistent use in your communications. They are particularly useful for sending frequently used messages, such as customer service responses or promotional content, via the WhatsApp channel.

## What is the difference between Snippets and WhatsApp Templates?

WhatsApp Templates are pre-approved message formats that businesses use to initiate conversations or send notifications to users outside the 24-hour customer service window. These templates must adhere to WhatsApp’s specific guidelines and policies, ensuring that they meet content standards and are not overly promotional. Before you can use a template, it needs to be reviewed and approved by Meta/WhatsApp. Once approved, these templates can be used repeatedly, often in scenarios such as sending order confirmations, appointment reminders, or alerts that require a structured format and compliance with WhatsApp's messaging policies. On the other hand, Snippets are pre-saved text blocks, also known as "canned responses," which are designed to be easily inserted into conversations. Unlike Templates, Snippets do not require approval from WhatsApp and can be customized on the fly, making them ideal for responding to frequently asked questions or providing quick, consistent answers during active customer support sessions. Since Snippets are used within the 24-hour customer service window, they are more flexible and can be tailored to fit the ongoing conversation without the need for pre-approval. Templates are WhatsApp templates which need to be approved Templates are templated messages that Meta/Whatsapp approve. Snippets are pre-saved text (aka "canned responses") that you can drop into any conversation.

##

##   

## Is there a time limit for sending Snippets to a contact via WhatsApp?

##   

## What happens if the 24-hour conversation window has expired?

##   

Answer: If the 24-hour window has expired, you will not be able to send a Snippet directly. In such cases, you may need to start a new conversation or use a pre-approved WhatsApp template.
