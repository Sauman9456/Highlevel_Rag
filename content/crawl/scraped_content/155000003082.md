box shadow and text shadow

 with easy-to-use dropdowns.

### **Enhanced Customization Parameters  **

  * Outer vs Inner Shadow: Outer shadows create a sense of elevation and depth, making elements appear raised above the background. Inner shadows add a recessed effect, giving the illusion of depth within the element.
  * X Value: Controls horizontal shadow offset.
  * Y Value: Controls vertical shadow offset.
  * Blur: Determines the sharpness or softness of the shadow.
  * Spread: Expands or contracts the shadow size.
  * Color: Chooses the shadow color to match your design palette.

  2. Open the Shadow dropdown: Click on the shadow heading at the top to reveal the shadow editor dropdowns.
  3. Select Shadow Type: Choose between box shadow or text shadow by clicking the plus button next to each title. (Text shadow is only applicable on text based elements)
