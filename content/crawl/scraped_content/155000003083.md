  1. ### What does HighLevel’s MAP Policy mean?

Our Minimum Advertised Pricing Policy means that when you resell our platform (or your white-label version of our platform), you may not advertise access to the Core Platform at a price of less than $97. This restriction applies solely to advertisements. The actual price at which you resell the Core Platform may be less than $97, so long as the actual price is not offered publicly and cannot be discovered through publicly-available or searchable forums, including but not limited to search engines, social media channels, blogs, websites, or other online forums. To read the full MAP Policy, please review Section 2 of HighLevel’s [Terms of Service](https://www.gohighlevel.com/terms-of-service).

  2. ### Does the MAP Policy apply to me?

If you resell the HighLevel Core Platform or a white-label version of our Core Platform, the MAP Policy applies to you.

  3. ### What is HighLevel’s “Core Platform?” Does the MAP Policy still apply to me if I’m only reselling one feature of the platform?

The MAP Policy does not apply to you if you are offering one platform feature as a true standalone product. The MAP Policy only applies to advertised prices for access to our Core Platform. We define our “Core Platform” as a combination of 2 or more of any of the following features:

  * Funnel and Website Builder

  * Forms

  * Surveys

  * Customer Relationship Manager

  * Email Builder

  * Calendar

  * Automation Workflows

It is a violation of the MAP Policy to advertise access to a standalone feature to bypass MAP Policy restrictions if you are actually providing access to the Core Platform. Similarly, you are prohibited from offering a standalone feature for less than $97 if you are bundling the standalone product with other “free” platform features.

  4. ### What if I live in a country where MAP Policies are prohibited?

We recommend consulting your own legal counsel to determine whether our MAP Policy applies to you. MAP Policies may be prohibited in some countries or regions, but the Policy may still apply to cross-border transactions with countries where MAP Policies are not prohibited.

  5. ### What are some of the exceptions to the MAP Policy?

The MAP Policy does not apply to physical displays at brick-and-mortar selling locations where the displayed price is not advertised outside of the store’s physical location. The Policy also does not apply to scenarios where discounted pricing is offered through private communication channels or displayed in an online shopping cart only after a customer “adds to cart.” The MAP Policy also does not apply to the offering of a single HighLevel platform feature not used in combination with any other features. HighLevel also reserves the right to grant exceptions to the MAP Policy at any time, for any reason, in its sole discretion. 

  6. ### None of the above-listed exceptions apply to me. Are there other ways to get an exception?

At this time, we are not granting MAP Policy Exceptions. HighLevel reserves the right to make exceptions to the MAP Policy on a case-by-case basis in its sole discretion.

  7. ### Does MAP Policy apply to me if…

  1. I’m only offering a limited feature set? The MAP Policy applies to you if you are reselling our Core Platform as defined above. If you are offering one feature as a standalone product, the MAP Policy does not apply.

  2. I’m offering access to HighLevel’s Core Platform as part of a larger bundle offering? The MAP Policy still applies to you if you’re offering access to HighLevel’s Core Platform as part of a larger bundle of products. The entire bundle that includes access to our Core Platform must be priced at or above $97. If your bundle includes only a single standalone feature, the MAP Policy does not apply.

  3. I’m offering a limited-time discount, special, or promotion? The MAP Policy still applies. You may not publicly advertise our Core Platform at a discounted, promotional, or special price below $97. However, you may advertise that you are running a promotion without disclosing the price and request that customers “add to cart” to see the discounted price. Alternatively, you can privately offer promotional codes for customers to enter at checkout in order to see the discounted price. 

  4. I’m offering a one-time-fee lifetime license to the platform? One-time-fee lIfetime license offers for our Core Platform are not permitted unless you have prior written approval from HighLevel. 

  5. I’m offering a price below $97 in a private message, private email, or other non-searchable, non-public forum? The MAP Policy applies to publicly advertised offers. Private offers under $97 are permitted, provided that they are not searchable or discoverable through search engines, social media, social media channels, blogs, websites, or other online forums.

  6. I do not publicly disclose my pricing, and customers can only see the price if they add the product to their shopping cart? This is permitted.

  7. I am targeting a geographic region where a $97 price point is not feasible for most customers given socioeconomic conditions and/or exchange rates? At this time, the MAP Policy applies to all countries and regions where not prohibited. We do not currently support differential pricing in different parts of the world.

  8. I am located in the EU or the UK? Our MAP Policy applies to our EU and UK customers, too. However, if you are in the EU or the UK, our MAP Policy does not prohibit you from offering discounts or communicating to customers that their final price could differ from the advertised price.

  8. ### What if I’m reselling in countries that use a different currency?

If you are selling in a country that does not use United States dollars, you may use appropriate exchange rates to convert the $97 minimum advertised price to the applicable foreign currency. You may not offer access to the Core Platform at a price below the foreign currency equivalent. You are responsible for periodically recalculating your price points to align with the MAP Policy in response to significant changes in exchange rates.

  9. ### I reported another customer who was violating MAP Policy, but they haven’t changed their pricing yet. Why not?

Sometimes it might take us a while to get in touch with potential MAP Policy violators. We appreciate your patience. If it’s been several weeks since your report, and no changes have been made, it’s possible that the alleged violator has a MAP Policy Exception. Note that for privacy and confidentiality reasons, HighLevel will not be able to disclose the outcome of our investigation in response to your MAP Policy violation report.

  10. ### I found an advertisement where another HighLevel customer might be violating the MAP Policy. Where do I report it?

You can anonymously report alleged MAP Policy violations here: [http://gohighlevel.com/MAPpolicyviolations](http://gohighlevel.com/MAPpolicyviolations). Alternatively, you can send the content link to [legalcompliance@gohighlevel.com](mailto:legalcompliance@gohighlevel.com)–we’ll take it from there!
