# Enhanced Email Verification for Campaigns!

Modified on: Fri, 16 Aug, 2024 at 10:43 PM

Previously, we did not verify email addresses for our email campaigns. This oversight could have led to identity spoofing and potential damage to your reputation.

To enhance security and protect your reputation, we now require verification of your From email address before sending an email campaign. This measure ensures that only valid email addresses are used, preventing anyone from spoofing your email address. 

In certain cases, email verification is not required:

  1. Custom domains provided under LC email.
  2. Location admin email present in settings.

## **How to Verify Your Email**

  1. Navigate to the email marketing section and create a campaign.
  2. Enter the email address you wish to verify in the sender email field.
  3. Click on the "Verify Now" option.

  4. Check your email for an OTP (One-Time Password) and enter the 6-digit OTP.

  5. Once the OTP is entered, your email address is verified and can be used for future campaigns.
  6. Additionally, this can also be done through the settings page, by clicking on "Verify an email"
