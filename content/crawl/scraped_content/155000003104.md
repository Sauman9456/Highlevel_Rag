## **Why Plain Text?**

Plain text emails offer a simple, personal approach similar to messages from your personal inbox. They focus on the message itself with minimal branding and design.

They have multiple use cases, some of them are -

  * Text heavy communications use big text snippets. This editor ensures symmetric readability across all devices.
  * Personalized emails like welcome emails or apology emails are still preferred to be direct and not design-heavy

## **What do the metrics say?**

Various researches have shown that the probability of a customer interacting with a plain text email is almost twice as high as that of a design-intensive email. 

## **Benefits:**

  * Simplicity: Easy to understand and use.

  * Personalization: Feels like a direct communication.

  * Compatibility: Fewer rendering issues across email clients. This looks great on any device

## **How to Use:**

  1. Navigate to "Email Marketing" -> "Templates".  

  2. Click "New" and select "Blank Template".  

  3. Choose the Plain Text editor.  

  4. Compose your email and attach images as needed.  

5\. Click on the three dots to handle the settings, send test email, or preview this email. Click on "Save template" to exit.
