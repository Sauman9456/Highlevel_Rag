# How to create a fixed countdown timer?

Modified on: Thu, 19 Sep, 2024 at 6:13 AM

A countdown timer is a powerful tool for creating urgency and excitement for upcoming events, product launches, sales, and sign-ups. It visually counts down the time remaining until a specific event or action, encouraging users to act quickly.  

**Where Can You Use a Countdown Timer?**

  1. **Product Launch**  
Use a countdown timer to build anticipation for the release of a new product. Display the timer on your landing page, emails, and social media to let customers know exactly when the product will become available.

  2. **Event Registration**  
If you’re hosting an event, a countdown timer can remind people of the registration deadline or when the event will start. Place the timer on your event page, in invitations, and in follow-up emails to keep potential attendees informed.

  3. **Sale**  
For limited-time sales or flash promotions, a countdown timer shows how much time is left to take advantage of special offers. Feature the timer on your sale page, in marketing emails, and on your website to drive urgency.

  4. **Sign-Up**  
When running a campaign that requires sign-ups or registrations, a countdown timer can highlight the deadline for joining. Include the timer on your sign-up page and in promotional materials to prompt users to register before time runs out.
