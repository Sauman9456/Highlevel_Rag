# How to create a recurring timer?

Modified on: Thu, 19 Sep, 2024 at 6:14 AM

A recurring timer is a useful tool for managing and promoting events, sales, or activities that happen regularly. Unlike a fixed timer, which counts down to a single event, a recurring timer resets after each cycle, providing ongoing reminders about repeating events or deadlines.

**Where Can You Use a Recurring Timer?**

  1. **Weekly Sales or Promotions**  
Use a recurring timer to highlight weekly sales or special offers that occur on a regular basis. Display the timer on your website, in emails, and on social media to remind customers of the recurring opportunity to save.

  2. **Monthly Subscriptions or Renewals**  
For subscription-based services or membership renewals, a recurring timer can remind users of their upcoming renewal date each month. Include it in your subscription management emails or on the user dashboard.

  3. **Regular Webinars or Classes**  
If you host webinars or classes on a regular schedule (e.g., every Tuesday), a recurring timer can show the time remaining until the next session. Embed the timer on your event registration page or in promotional emails.

  4. **Daily Deals or Flash Offers**  
For daily deals or limited-time flash offers that repeat every day or week, a recurring timer can create a sense of urgency and remind customers of the next opportunity to take advantage of the deal.
