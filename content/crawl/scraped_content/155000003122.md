# How to use countdown timer in funnels?

Modified on: Thu, 19 Sep, 2024 at 6:12 AM

Countdown timers are great for creating urgency and getting people to act quickly by showing how much time is left before an offer or deadline ends. To be most effective, make sure the timer on your funnel page matches the one in your emails. This consistency helps keep your message clear and encourages people to take action.

### **Things to Know Before Using the Countdown Timer Element in Funnels**

#### ** _HTML Timer: Countdown Timer chosen from the element_**

  * **Functionality:** The HTML-based countdown timer will accurately replicate the timer’s details and perform better.
  * **Design:** The timer element copies the timer’s details but not the design styles. You may need to adjust the appearance separately to match your branding.

  * **Functionality:** When using a timer code in a code block, it will display the correct design.
  * **Limitations:** This type of timer is essentially a GIF and will only be active for 60 seconds per session. For a longer-lasting timer, the HTML-based option is preferable.
