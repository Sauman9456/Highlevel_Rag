Modified on: Wed, 21 Aug, 2024 at 8:49 PM

The restrictions on features, pricing and trial period in SaaS Configurator have been removed. SaaSpreneurs now have the freedom to run their SaaS business however they decide to.

What has changed?

  * This will allow SaaS businesses to target specific audiences for very specific use cases.

2\. Flexible Pricing

  * The price floor and cap limits have now been removed.
  * Prices can now vary upwards of $1 without any restrictions based on the prices of other plan in the category.

3\. Longer Trial Periods

  * The 30 day limit for setting trial period has now been changed to 365 days.
