# SEO Heatmaps in the Prospecting Tool: A Support Guide

Modified on: Fri, 23 Aug, 2024 at 2:54 AM

# **Overview**

The SEO Heatmap feature in the Prospecting Tool provides a visual representation of your prospect’s search engine rankings. This feature allows agencies and businesses to quickly understand where their website stands in search results for specific keywords and locations, helping improve visibility and optimise SEO efforts.  

# **What is an SEO Heatmap?**

The SEO Heatmap is a tool that plots search rankings across nine key points on a map, giving a geographic view of how well a website ranks in different locations. Each point on the heatmap corresponds to a specific location around the prospect's business, helping to identify areas where the business has strong visibility versus areas that need improvement.

### How It Works:

The SEO Heatmap evaluates search visibility based on rankings across multiple points:

  1. **Central Point (20% Weight)** : The central location of the business. This point receives the highest weight in the overall score and reflects the visibility of the business in its immediate area.

  2. **Outer Points (10% Weight Each)** : Eight surrounding points that represent nearby areas. These points help provide insight into how well the business ranks in neighboring locations.

Each point is assigned a rank based on the business’s position in search results for the selected keyword or keyword set.

### Scoring:

  * **Central Point** : Contributes 20% to the overall SEO score, focusing on the business's rank in its core area.
  * **Outer Points** : Each of the surrounding points contributes 10% to the score, evaluating the business's reach into adjacent regions.

The higher the rank of a point, the better the visibility in that location, and the stronger the overall SEO performance.

### Benefits of the SEO Heatmap:

  * **Geographic Insights** : It helps you visualize your ranking performance across different areas, providing a clear picture of where SEO efforts are succeeding or need improvement.
  * **Targeted Optimizations** : Use the heatmap to identify specific geographic areas where visibility is lacking and optimize your SEO strategy to boost rankings in those locations.
  * **Improved Local Search Strategy** : For businesses relying on local search, this heatmap can reveal how well they are performing in nearby areas, helping them adjust their local SEO strategies accordingly.

### How to Access:

  1. Navigate to the **Prospecting Tool** in your account.
  2. Select the **SEO Heatmap** section.
  3. The heatmap will display rankings for the selected business or prospect.

### Best Practices:

  * Regularly check the SEO Heatmap to monitor changes in search rankings.
  * Use the data to focus on improving rankings in areas with lower visibility.
  * Combine heatmap insights with other SEO tools to refine your strategy and boost overall online presence.
