# How to Add Multiple Chat Widgets to the Same Website

Modified on: Fri, 11 Oct, 2024 at 2:25 PM

## **What's New?**

Multiple Chat Widget: Add multiple chat widgets with different designs and customizations on different landing pages.

Streamlined Code: This release reduces the code required for installation, enhancing overall performance.

Hassle-Free Updates: You no longer need to reinstall the code when making changes or updating widget settings.

## **How Does it work?**

  1. Go to Sites > Chat Widget

  2. There will be the option of Create New Chat Widget

  3. There are three option - SMS/Phone Chat, Live Chat and WhatsApp Chat. User will select one option for chat type.

 Note - The current setup will become the default chat widget.

  4. In Funnels or Websites, the user will be able to select the chat widget option to get more. WordPress will support the default chat widget.
