**Scenario:** A Saloon wants to ensure that any note labeled "Haircut" triggers an immediate internal notification to the saloon manager.

#### **Trigger Setup:**

  * **Name:** Haircut Note Alert
  * **Filter:** Note contains the tag "Haircut"

#### **Workflow Actions:**

  1. **Notification:** Send an internal notification to the saloon manager with the content of the note.
  2. **Task Creation:** Automatically create a task for the saloon manager to review the note.

**Outcome:** This automation ensures that any note marked as "Haircut" is immediately flagged for the saloon manager’s attention, enabling prompt action and improving response times for critical issues.
