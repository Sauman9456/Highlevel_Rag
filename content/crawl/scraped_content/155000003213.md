    **IMPORTANT:  **Email tracking is **ONLY** available if you are using LC Email. This feature is not available for any other email provider, such as Mailgun, Gmail, or others.

Tracking email engagement is crucial for tailoring your email marketing strategy. In this article, you’ll learn how to enable or disable open and click tracking for your emails, ensuring that your email campaigns align with your specific needs. We’ll guide you through the simple steps to adjust these settings within your Sub-account, allowing you to customize tracking for each dedicated domain.

# **What is Email Tracking?**

Email tracking refers to the ability to monitor and record specific actions recipients take when they interact with your emails. This includes tracking when an email is opened (open tracking) and when links within the email are clicked (click tracking).

By enabling these features, you can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of your email campaigns, such as understanding recipient engagement and optimizing your marketing strategies based on real-time data.

## **Why You Should Use Email Tracking**

You should use email tracking because it provides valuable insights into how your audience engages with your emails, allowing you to refine your marketing strategies and improve your overall campaign performance.

By tracking opens and clicks, you can identify which content resonates most with your audience, optimize your messaging, and increase conversions.

**Imagine you’re running an email campaign to promote a new product launch:**

By using email tracking, you can see which recipients opened your email and clicked on the product link.

Now, suppose you notice that a significant number of people clicked on the link but didn’t complete the purchase. This data could prompt you to follow up with a targeted email offering a limited-time discount or additional information, ultimately driving more sales.

Without email tracking, you’d be left guessing about your audience’s behavior, missing out on opportunities to optimize your campaign.

## **Where To Find Email Tracking**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: What type of data is collected when tracking email activity?**

HighLevel collects engagement data and attributes that data to contacts in your sub-account records. So for example, if you send Jane Doe and email, she will appear in the email tracking analytics so you know if she engaged with the email in any way. Within email tracking analytics, you'll see the following data:

  * Email Sent
  * Email Delivered
  * Email Opened
  * Email Clicked (link inside the email)
  * Email Bounced
  * Complained (marked as spam)
  * Unsubscribed
  * Email Failed to Send

### **Q: Can I track email activity if I am using Mailgun to sent emails?**

No, you cannot. Email tracking analytics is only available if you are using LC Email as your SMTP provider when sending emails out of your sub-account.

### **Q: Can I track emails sent from my Gmail email address?**

No. You need to send emails from an LC Email dedicated sending domain to be able to track the email activity and engagement. You can still use your Gmail address as a "From Name" when sending emails, but you cannot use email tracking if Google is your SMTP provider.

### **Q: What happens if we turn off email tracking?**

If you turn off email tracking you will no longer have visibility into the data provided such as emails that were successfully sent, opened, clicked, etc. We recommend that you keep email tracking on in order to have full visibility into which prospects and customers are engaging with your email campaigns.
