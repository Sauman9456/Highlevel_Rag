## Overview

The **Note Added** trigger is used to initiate specific actions within a workflow whenever a new note is added to a contact's record. This trigger is ideal for tasks such as notifying team members about updates, tagging contacts based on the content of the note, or initiating follow-up actions.

## Trigger Name

**Note Added**

## Trigger Description

The **Note Added** trigger activates a workflow whenever a new note is added to a contact's profile. This allows for real-time actions based on note entries, such as alerting sales teams, updating contact statuses, or setting follow-up reminders.

## How to Configure

To configure the **Note Added** trigger, set the workflow trigger name and choose from available filters to refine the conditions under which this workflow is activated.

## Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger Name| Name given to the trigger for easy identification.| Yes  
Doesn't Have Tag| Workflow will only trigger if the contact does not have a specified tag.| No  
Has Tag| Workflow will trigger only if the contact has a specified tag.| No  

## Example

In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when a new note is added to a contact who has a specific tag:

  1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** `Note Added`
  2. **Filters:**
     * **Has Tag:** `VIP Customer`

####   

#### **Example Workflow**

When a note is added to a contact record, the following actions could be triggered:

  * **Notify Sales Team:** Send an internal notification to the assigned sales team member to review the note added to a VIP customer's profile.
  * **Add Follow-up Task:** Automatically create a task for the account manager to follow up with the customer based on the note's content.
  * **Tag Contact:** If the note indicates a particular interest or issue, automatically add a relevant tag to the contact to categorize them accordingly.

This configuration ensures that the workflow activates whenever a note is added, allowing for immediate and relevant actions based on the content and context of the note.
