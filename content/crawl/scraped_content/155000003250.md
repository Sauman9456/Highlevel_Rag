## Overview

The **Offer Access Granted** trigger is designed to initiate a workflow when access to a specific offer is granted to a contact. This is particularly useful for managing follow-up actions, personalized communications, or administrative tasks associated with granting access to offers.

## Trigger Name

**Offer Access Granted**

## Trigger Description

The **Offer Access Granted** trigger activates a workflow when a contact is granted access to a particular offer. This can be used to automate processes such as sending confirmation emails, welcoming new members, or updating internal systems.

## How to Configure

To configure the **Offer Access Granted** trigger, set the workflow trigger name and choose from available filters to specify the conditions under which this workflow is activated.

Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger Name| Name given to the trigger for easy identification.| Yes  
Offer| The specific offer that, when granted, will trigger the workflow.| Yes  
  
####   

## Example

In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when a contact is granted access to the "15% Early Bird Discount" offer:

  1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** `Offer Access Granted`
  2. **Filters:**
     * **Offer:** `15% Early Bird Discount`

####   

#### **Example Workflow**

When access is granted to the selected offer, the following actions could be triggered:

  * **Send Welcome Email:** Automatically send an email to the contact, welcoming them and providing details about their new access.
  * **Update CRM Record:** Update the contact’s record in the CRM to reflect their access to the offer, ensuring accurate tracking and reporting.
  * **Notify Sales Team:** Send an internal notification to the sales team informing them of the new access granted to the contact, allowing them to follow up if necessary.

This configuration ensures that whenever a contact gains access to a specified offer, appropriate actions are automatically initiated, enhancing customer experience and streamlining internal processes.
