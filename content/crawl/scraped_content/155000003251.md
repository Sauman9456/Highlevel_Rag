## Overview

The **Offer Access Removed** trigger is designed to activate a workflow when access to a specific offer is revoked from a contact. This feature is useful for managing follow-up actions, informing relevant parties, or taking necessary steps to ensure a smooth transition for the contact after their access is removed.

## Trigger Name

**Offer Access Removed**

## Trigger Description

The **Offer Access Removed** trigger initiates a workflow when a contact's access to a particular offer is revoked. This can be used to automate tasks such as sending a notification to the contact, updating internal systems, or notifying relevant team members.

## How to Configure

To configure the **Offer Access Removed** trigger, set the workflow trigger name and choose from available filters to specify the conditions under which this workflow is activated.

Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger Name| Name given to the trigger for easy identification.| Yes  
Offer| The specific offer that, when access is removed, will trigger the workflow.| Yes  

## Example

In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when a contact's access to the "15% Early Bird Discount" offer is removed:

  1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** `Offer Access Removed`
  2. **Filters:**
     * **Offer:** `15% Early Bird Discount`

####   

#### **Example Workflow**

When access is removed from the selected offer, the following actions could be triggered:

  * **Send Access Revoked Email:** Automatically send an email to the contact informing them that their access to the offer has been revoked and providing any necessary next steps.
  * **Update CRM Record:** Update the contact’s record in the CRM to reflect the removal of access to the offer, ensuring accurate tracking and reporting.
  * **Notify Support Team:** Send an internal notification to the support team informing them of the removal, allowing them to follow up with the contact if necessary.

This configuration ensures that whenever a contact's access to a specified offer is revoked, appropriate actions are automatically initiated, maintaining communication and operational efficiency.
