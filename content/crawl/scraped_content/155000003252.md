## Overview

The **Opportunity Status Changed** trigger is used to initiate a workflow when the status of a sales opportunity changes. This trigger helps in automating follow-up actions and internal notifications based on the change in the opportunity's status.

## Trigger Name

**Opportunity Status Changed**

## Trigger Description

The **Opportunity Status Changed** trigger activates a workflow when there is a change in the status of an opportunity. This could be used to update relevant stakeholders, adjust the opportunity's details in the CRM, or trigger communications with the associated contact.

## How to Configure

To configure the **Opportunity Status Changed** trigger, provide a descriptive workflow trigger name and set up filters to specify the conditions under which this workflow should be activated.

Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger Name| Name assigned to the trigger for easy identification.| Yes  
Assigned to| Specify the user or team assigned to the opportunity.| No  
Has Tag| Filter opportunities based on specific tags.| No  
In pipeline| Choose the pipeline in which the opportunity is located.| No  
Lead value| Define the value of the lead to trigger the workflow when the opportunity status changes.| No  
Lost Reason| Identify the reason for losing the opportunity to trigger relevant workflows.| No  
Moved from status| Specify the original status before the change to capture transitions between specific statuses.| No  
Moved to status| Define the new status after the change to capture transitions between specific statuses.| No  

## Example

In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when an opportunity's status changes from "Negotiation" to "Closed Won" and is assigned to a specific sales representative:

  1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** `Opportunity Status Changed`
  2. **Filters:**
     * **Assigned to:** `John Doe`
     * **Moved from status:** `Negotiation`
     * **Moved to status:** `Closed Won`

####   

#### **Example Workflow**

When the status of an opportunity changes as specified:

  * **Send Congratulations Email:** Automatically send an email to the sales representative congratulating them on closing the deal.
  * **Update CRM Record:** Update the opportunity's status in the CRM to reflect the new status, ensuring accurate tracking and reporting.
  * **Notify Finance Team:** Send an internal notification to the finance team to begin the invoicing process, ensuring timely billing and payment collection.
  * **Log Activity:** Record the status change in the opportunity's activity log for future reference and performance tracking.

This configuration ensures that whenever there is a status change in an opportunity, the appropriate actions are taken automatically, maintaining efficiency and communication within the sales team and other departments.
