## Overview

The **Order Form Submission** trigger is designed to initiate a workflow whenever a customer submits an order form. This trigger is useful for automating processes related to order management, customer follow-up, and other sales-related tasks.

## Trigger Name

**Order Form Submission**

## Trigger Description

The **Order Form Submission** trigger activates a workflow when a customer completes and submits an order form. It allows you to automate actions such as sending confirmation emails, updating CRM records, and notifying sales teams.

## How to Configure

To configure the **Order Form Submission** trigger, provide a clear workflow trigger name and set up filters to define the conditions that should activate the workflow.

Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Workflow Trigger Name| The name assigned to this trigger for easy identification.| Yes  
In funnel/website| Choose the specific funnel or website where the order form is located.| No  
Submission type| Select the type of submission, such as purchase or lead form, to filter which submissions will trigger the workflow.| No  

## Example

In this example, the workflow is set up to trigger when an order form is submitted through a specific funnel for purchasing a particular product:

  1. **Workflow Trigger Name:** `Order Form Submission`
  2. **Filters:**
     * **In funnel/website:** `Product Purchase Funnel`
     * **Submission type:** `Purchase`

####   

#### **Example Workflow**

When the specified order form is submitted:

  * **Send Order Confirmation Email:** Automatically send a confirmation email to the customer acknowledging the receipt of their order.
  * **Update CRM Record:** Update the customer's record in the CRM to reflect the new order, including details such as order number and purchase date.
  * **Notify Sales Team:** Send a notification to the sales team to inform them about the new order, allowing them to prepare for fulfillment and follow-up.
  * **Add Tag to Customer Record:** Tag the customer with the product name to segment them for future marketing campaigns related to similar products.

This configuration ensures that all necessary actions are taken automatically when an order form is submitted, improving efficiency and accuracy in order processing and customer communication.
