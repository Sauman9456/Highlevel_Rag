## Overview

The "Product Access Granted" trigger is used to automate actions when a customer is granted access to a specific product. This can include online courses, digital content, or any other product requiring access permissions. Automating actions such as sending welcome emails, providing instructions, or updating CRM records can enhance customer experience and streamline operations.

## Trigger Name

**Product Access Granted**

## Trigger Description

This trigger is activated when a customer gains access to a product. It helps automate processes like sending welcome messages, onboarding instructions, or offering additional resources. The trigger can be configured to activate based on specific products, allowing tailored responses.

## How to Configure

  * **Choose a Workflow Trigger:** Select "Product Access Granted" from the list of available triggers.
  * **Workflow Trigger Name:** Enter a name that clearly identifies the purpose of the trigger, such as "Product Access Granted."
  * **Filters:** Use filters to specify which product access will trigger the workflow. This can be useful when offering multiple products and you want to tailor responses or actions based on the specific product accessed.

Value| Description| Mandatory

## Example

An online learning platform wants to send a welcome email and onboarding instructions to customers who are granted access to the "Learn how to build a course" product.

  * **Configuration:**
    * **Trigger:** Product Access Granted
    * **Filters:**
      * **Select Product:** Learn how to build a course
  * **Actions:** When the trigger is activated:
    1. Send a personalized welcome email to the customer, congratulating them on gaining access to the "Learn how to build a course" product.
    2. Include onboarding instructions and links to the first module of the course in the email.
    3. Add the customer to a dedicated email list for course updates and additional resources.
    4. Update the customer's profile in the CRM to reflect their enrollment in the course.

This setup ensures that customers receive immediate acknowledgment and guidance upon gaining product access, leading to a smoother onboarding process and improved customer satisfaction.
