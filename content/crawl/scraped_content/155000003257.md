## Overview

The **"Product Access Removed"** trigger is used to automate actions when a customer no longer has access to a specific product. This can be useful in managing customer relationships, sending notifications, and updating internal systems to reflect the change in product access status. Automating these actions ensures that both the customer and internal teams are aware of the changes.

## Trigger Name

**Product Access Removed  
**

## Trigger Description

This trigger activates when a customer’s access to a product is revoked or removed. It allows businesses to take automated actions such as sending notifications to the customer, updating CRM systems, or managing access permissions. The trigger can be tailored to specific products, making it versatile for various scenarios.

## How to Configure

  * **Choose a Workflow Trigger:** Select "Product Access Removed" from the list of available triggers.
  * **Workflow Trigger Name:** Enter a name that clearly identifies the purpose of the trigger, such as "Product Access Removed."
  * **Filters:** Use filters to specify which product access removal will trigger the workflow. This filter helps tailor responses based on the specific product whose access is removed.

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Select Product| Choose the specific product that will activate the trigger when access is granted.| Optional  

## Example

An online learning platform wants to send a notification to customers when their access to the "Learn how to build a course" product is removed. This notification will inform the customer about the removal and provide information on how to regain access if desired.

  * **Configuration:**
    * **Trigger:** Product Access Removed
    * **Filters:**
      * **Select Product:** Learn how to build a course
  * **Actions:** When the trigger is activated:
    1. Send an email notification to the customer, informing them that their access to the "Learn how to build a course" product has been removed.
    2. Provide details on why access was removed and steps they can take to regain access, such as renewing their subscription or contacting support.
    3. Update the customer's profile in the CRM to reflect the change in product access.
    4. Optionally, notify the support or sales team to follow up with the customer for potential retention efforts.

This setup ensures that customers are promptly informed about changes to their product access and provides clear instructions on how to proceed, enhancing customer service and engagement.
