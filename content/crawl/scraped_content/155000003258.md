## Overview

The "**Product Completed** " trigger is designed to automate follow-up actions when a customer completes a product or course. This trigger is valuable for engaging with customers after they finish a product, such as sending a congratulatory message, gathering feedback, or offering additional products or courses.

## Trigger Name

**Product Completed**

## Trigger Description

This trigger activates when a customer has successfully completed a product, such as an online course or a membership module. It allows businesses to automatically take actions that can enhance the customer experience, foster engagement, and encourage continued interaction with other products or services.

## How to Configure

  * **Choose a Workflow Trigger:** Select "Product Completed" from the list of available triggers.
  * **Workflow Trigger Name:** Enter a name for the trigger, such as "Product Completed."
  * **Filters:** Use filters to specify which product completions will activate the workflow. Filters help in setting specific criteria, such as selecting certain products or using operators to refine the conditions.

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Product| Select the specific product or group of products that will activate the trigger upon completion.| Optional  
Select Operator| Choose an operator like "Is any of" to include specific products or "Is none of" to exclude certain products from triggering the workflow.| Optional  

## Example

A learning platform wants to automatically send a follow-up survey to users who complete the "Advanced Marketing Strategies" course to gather feedback and encourage them to enroll in other courses.

  * **Configuration:**
    * **Trigger:** Product Completed
    * **Filters:**
      * **Product:** Advanced Marketing Strategies
      * **Select Operator:** Is any of (to include the specific course)
  * **Actions:** When the trigger is activated:
    1. Send a congratulatory email to the user, acknowledging the completion of the "Advanced Marketing Strategies" course.
    2. Include a link to a feedback survey to understand the user’s experience and gather insights for improvement.
    3. Offer a discount code or promotion for enrolling in another related course, such as "Social Media Marketing Mastery."
    4. Update the user's progress in the CRM to reflect course completion, which can be used for future engagement and upselling opportunities.

This configuration ensures that the organization maintains an active relationship with the customer, gathers valuable feedback, and promotes continued learning opportunities, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
