## Overview

The **Survey Submitted** trigger allows you to initiate a workflow whenever a contact submits a survey. This can be useful for automating follow-up actions based on survey responses, such as sending a thank-you email, updating contact information, or adding tags based on the survey results.

## Trigger Name

**Survey Submitted**

## Trigger Description

This trigger is activated when a contact submits a survey. You can configure it with specific filters to target particular surveys or survey responses, allowing for tailored automation based on the contact's feedback.

## How to Configure

  * **Choose a Workflow Trigger** : Select **Survey Submitted** from the list of available triggers.

  * **Workflow Trigger Name** : Enter a descriptive name for your trigger, such as "Survey Submitted."

  * **Filters** : Use filters to refine when the trigger should activate. This allows you to specify which survey submissions should start the workflow.

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Disqualified| Indicates if the survey response disqualifies the contact. Options are is true or is false.| No  
Survey is| Selects specific surveys to trigger the workflow. You can choose one or multiple surveys from the list.| No  

## Example

You want to create a workflow that triggers when a contact submits a feedback survey and is not disqualified. The workflow will then send a follow-up email thanking the contact for their participation.

  * **Workflow Trigger Name** : "Feedback Survey Submitted"
  * **Filters** :
    * **Disqualified** : `is false` (Only trigger if the contact is not disqualified)
    * **Survey is** : "Customer Satisfaction Survey"

**Workflow Steps** :

  1. **Trigger** : Survey Submitted (as configured above)
  2. **Action** : Send Email - "Thank you for your feedback!"
  3. **Action** : Update Contact Field - Mark the survey as "Completed."
