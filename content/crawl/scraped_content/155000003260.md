## Overview

The **Task Added** trigger allows you to initiate a workflow whenever a new task is added to a contact's record. This is useful for automating actions based on task creation, such as notifying the assigned user, updating task-related fields, or sending follow-up messages.

## Trigger Name

**Task Added**

## Trigger Description

This trigger is activated when a new task is added to a contact's record. You can use filters to specify which tasks should start the workflow, such as tasks assigned to a particular user or tasks containing specific keywords.

## How to Configure

  * **Choose a Workflow Trigger** : Select **Task Added** from the list of available triggers.

  * **Workflow Trigger Name** : Enter a descriptive name for your trigger, such as "Task Added."

  * **Filters** : Use filters to refine when the trigger should activate. This allows you to specify which tasks should start the workflow based on the assigned user.

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Assigned User| Selects specific users to trigger the workflow when a task is assigned to them. You can choose one or multiple users.| No  

## Example

You want to create a workflow that triggers when a new task is added and is assigned to a specific user. The workflow will then send an email to notify the user about the new task.

  * **Workflow Trigger Name** : "New Task Assigned"
  * **Filters** :
    * **Assigned User** : "John Doe" (Only trigger if the task is assigned to John Doe)

**Workflow Steps** :

  1. **Trigger** : Task Added (as configured above)
  2. **Action** : Send Email - Notify the assigned user about the new task.
  3. **Action** : Update Task Status - Mark the task as "Notified."
