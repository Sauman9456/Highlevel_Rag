## Overview

The **TikTok Form Submitted** trigger is designed to start a workflow whenever a form is submitted via TikTok. This can be particularly useful for capturing leads, collecting feedback, or gathering information from TikTok users, and then automating subsequent actions.

## Trigger Name

**TikTok Form Submit**

## Trigger Description

This trigger activates a workflow when a specific form on TikTok is submitted. You can specify which form submissions should trigger the workflow using filters, ensuring that only relevant submissions start the workflow.

## How to Configure

  * **Choose a Workflow Trigger** : Select **TikTok Form Submitted** from the list of available triggers.

  * **Workflow Trigger Name** : Enter a descriptive name for your trigger, such as "TikTok Lead Capture" or "TikTok Feedback Form."

  * **Filters** : Use filters to specify which form submissions will activate the workflow. You can filter based on the form name to narrow down the trigger to specific forms.

Value| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
In Form| Selects the specific TikTok form that will trigger the workflow when submitted.| Yes  

## Example

You want to create a workflow that sends a thank-you email to users after they submit a feedback form on TikTok.

  * **Workflow Trigger Name** : "TikTok Feedback Thank You"
  * **Filters** :
    * **In Form** : "TikTok Feedback Form" (Only submissions from this form will trigger the workflow)

**Workflow Steps** :

  1. **Trigger** : TikTok Form Submitted (as configured above)
  2. **Action** : Send Email - Thank the user for their feedback.
  3. **Action** : Update Contact - Tag the contact as "Feedback Provided" to keep track of users who have submitted feedback.
