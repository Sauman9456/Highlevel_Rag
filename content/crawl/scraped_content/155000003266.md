## Overview

The **Remove Contact Tag** action is used to remove specific tags from a contact's profile within your CRM. This action is useful for managing contact segments, updating contact status, and ensuring accurate tracking of interactions and behaviors.

## Action Name

**Remove Contact Tag**

## Action Description

This action removes the selected or all tag(s) from a contact's record. Tags are often used to categorize contacts based on their interactions, interests, or status. By removing a tag, you can alter a contact's segmentation and the workflows they may be a part of.

## Action Details

Field Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Tags| Select the tag(s) you wish to remove from the contact's profile. You can choose multiple tags.| Yes  
Remove All Tags| Switch on the toggle if you want to remove all the tags| No  

**How to Configure the Remove Contact Tag Action** :

  1. **Action Name** : Enter a meaningful name for the action. This name will help you identify the purpose of this action in the workflow.
  2. **Tags** : Click on the "Select a tag" dropdown and choose the tag(s) you want to remove from the contact. You can select multiple tags if needed.
  3. **Remove All Tags:** Switch on the toggle if you want all the tags to removed. When the toggle is switched on they user will not be able to access the "Tags" field.

**Suggested Triggers to Combine with This Action (But not limited to)**

  1. **Customer Replied** : Use this trigger to remove a tag based on specific keywords or phrases in a customer's reply. For example, if a customer responds with "unsubscribe" or "not interested," you might remove tags like "Interested" or "Potential Lead."

  2. **Appointment Status Changed** : This trigger can initiate the tag removal action if an appointment is canceled or rescheduled. You could remove tags like "Appointment Booked" to accurately reflect the contact's current status.

  3. **Survey Submitted** : If a survey response indicates that a contact is no longer interested in a service or product, use this trigger to remove tags that categorize them as a potential customer.

##   

## Example

**Configuration Example** :

You are running a campaign where contacts are tagged as "Interested" when they sign up for a webinar. If they do not attend the webinar, you want to remove this tag to avoid sending them follow-up emails intended for engaged participants.

  * **Action Name** : "Remove Webinar Interested Tag"
  * **Tags** : "Interested"

**Workflow Steps** :

  1. **Trigger** : Webinar Not Attended - Triggers if a contact does not attend the scheduled webinar.
  2. **Action** : Remove Contact Tag - Configured to remove the "Interested" tag from these contacts.
  3. **Action** : Update Contact Field - Optionally, add a new tag like "Missed Webinar" to accurately segment these contacts for future follow-ups or different workflows.
