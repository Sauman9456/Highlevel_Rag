## Overview

The **Remove Assigned User** action is used to unassign users from a contact, effectively leaving the contact unassigned. This action is beneficial in workflows where contacts need to be removed from user assignment due to changes in their status, criteria, or workflow needs.

## Action Name

**Remove Assigned User**

## Action Description

This action removes any currently assigned user from a contact, making the contact unassigned. It is useful for scenarios where a contact's relationship with a specific user needs to be reset or when the contact needs to be re-entered into an assignment workflow without a current user assignment.

## Action Details

Field Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Action Name| Enter a name for this action to identify it within the workflow.| Yes  

**How to Configure the Remove Assigned User Action** :

  1. **Action Name** : Provide a descriptive name for this action, such as "Reset User Assignment" or "Clear Assigned User."
  2. There are no specific fields to configure beyond the action name, making it straightforward to implement.

**Some Triggers to Combine with This Action (But not limited to)**

  1. **Task Completed** : Use this trigger to remove a user assignment once a specific task related to the contact is completed, freeing up the user for new assignments.

  2. **Opportunity Status Changed** : Combine with this action when an opportunity's status changes (e.g., from "active" to "closed"), ensuring that the contact is no longer assigned to a user once the opportunity is no longer active.

  3. **Appointment Cancelled** : If an appointment is canceled, use this trigger to remove the assigned user, indicating that follow-up might no longer be necessary.

##   

## Example

**Configuration Example** :

In a workflow where contacts are frequently assigned and reassigned based on the stage of engagement:

  * **Action Name** : "Remove User After Follow-Up"

**Workflow Steps** :

  1. **Trigger** : Opportunity Status Changed - This trigger activates when an opportunity associated with the contact is marked as "Closed."
  2. **Action** : Remove Assigned User - This action unassigns the contact from any user to prepare them for a new cycle of follow-up or to remove their need for ongoing direct user engagement.
