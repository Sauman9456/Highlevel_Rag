## Overview

The **Manual SMS** action allows you to create a task for a user to manually send an SMS to a contact. This is useful when you want a personalized message sent that requires human intervention. The task created will appear in the Conversations > Manual Actions tab.

## Action Name

**Manual SMS**

## Action Description

This action generates a manual task to send an SMS message to a specific contact. The task requires user intervention to finalise and send the message. Users can select a template, add custom values, include trigger links, and test the message before sending.

## Action Details

Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Action Name| Name of the action to identify it in the workflow.| Yes  
Templates| Select an SMS template from the pre-defined templates available.| No  
Message| The message body to be sent. This field supports custom values and trigger links.| Yes  
Custom Values| Custom values available for personalising the message. Examples include contact name, appointment details, etc.| No  
Add Attachment| Option to add attachments to the SMS message via URL.| No  
Test Phone Number| A phone number to send a test SMS. Include country code.| No  

### **How to Configure**

  1. **Select Template** : Choose a pre-defined SMS template if applicable. This populates the message field with the template content.
  2. **Enter Message** : Write the message you want to send. Use the custom values dropdown to insert placeholders for dynamic data (e.g., contact name, appointment details).
  3. **Add Attachment** : If needed, add files by entering the URL.
  4. **Test SMS** : Enter a phone number to test how the SMS will appear when received.

### **Custom Values and Trigger Links**

The Manual SMS action supports custom values as well as Trigger links in the body of the message. 

Such as joining a calendar community or filling out a custom form. These links are clickable and can direct the contact to specific actions.

### 

## Example

  * **Trigger** : When a lead fills out a form on the website.
  * **Action** : Create a Manual SMS task for the assigned user to send a follow-up SMS.
  * **Message** : "Hi {{Contact Name}}, thank you for filling out our form. Click here to schedule an appointment: [Calendar Link]."
  * **Test Phone Number** : +11234567890 (for testing the SMS)

In this example, when a lead submits a form, a manual task is created to send a personalised SMS with a link to book an appointment. The message uses custom values to personalise the text and a trigger link for scheduling.
