The **Google My Business (GMB)** action allows you to send messages to contacts via Google My Business messaging, providing a direct way to engage with your customers. This action can be configured to send personalized messages using custom values and trigger links.

## Action Name

**GMB (Google My Business)**

## Action Description

This action sends a message to a contact through Google My Business, enabling you to communicate directly via GMB's messaging platform. It supports custom values and clickable trigger links, making your messages interactive and personalized.

## Action Details

Field| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Action Name| The name of the action. Default is "GMB".| Yes  
Message| The body of the message to be sent. Supports text, custom values, and trigger links.| Yes  

### **How to configure**

  * **Action Name** : Enter a name for the action. By default, it's set to "GMB".
  * **Message** : Write your message in the text box. You can use:
    * **Custom Values** : Click on the `{}` icon to insert custom values such as contact details, appointment information, or other dynamic data points.
    * **Trigger Links** : Use the link icon to add predefined links, which can be selected from the list. These links will be clickable in the GMB message.

## Example

To use the GMB action effectively, consider the following workflow configuration:

  1. **Trigger** : Choose a relevant trigger such as "Appointment Reminder".
  2. **Action** : Set the GMB action with a message like:
     * **Message** : "Hello {{contact.name}}, this is a reminder for your upcoming appointment on {{appointment.date}}. If you have any questions, please let us know!"
     * Use the `{}` icon to insert custom values like contact name and appointment date.

By setting up the action this way, you ensure that each contact receives a personalized reminder through Google My Business, making your interactions more meaningful and engaging.
