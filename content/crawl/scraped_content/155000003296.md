# **Migrate Contacts**

Contacts are the core of your marketing and CRM efforts. Migrating contacts involves exporting data from ActiveCampaign and importing it into HighLevel. This process includes ensuring the data format is compatible, mapping fields correctly, and handling any potential errors.

### _**Step 1:**__** ** Export Contacts from ActiveCampaign_

  * **Access Contacts:** Log in to ActiveCampaign and navigate to the Contacts section via the left-hand menu.  

  * **Initiate Export:** Click the Export button located at the top right of the Contacts page.  

  * **Select Fields:** In the export options, select the fields you wish to include in the CSV file. Typically, you should include fields such as Email, First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Tags, and any relevant custom fields.  

  * **Name the Export:** Enter a name for the export file. Important: Avoid using special characters (e.g., !, #, $) as these may cause issues when importing into HighLevel.  

  * **Download Export:** Click Export. ActiveCampaign will generate a CSV file which you can download once it’s ready. This file will contain all the selected contact information.

### **_Step 2:  _**_Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import_

  * **Check Date Formats:** Ensure all date fields in the CSV are in the YYYY-MM-DD format. This is essential for compatibility with HighLevel.  

  * **Encode Special Characters:** Make sure the CSV file uses UTF-8 character encoding to properly handle special and accented characters.  

  * **Clean Up Data:** Remove any line breaks, emojis, and unnecessary special characters from the file. This step helps prevent import errors.  

  * **Verify Email Addresses:  **Confirm that each contact in the CSV has a valid email address, as this is a required field for importing into HighLevel.

### **_Step 3:  _**_Import Contacts into HighLevel_

  * **Log in to HighLevel:  **Navigate to the Contacts section using the left-hand menu.  

  * **Start Import Process:  **Click the Import Contacts button.  

  * **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the prepared CSV file.  

  * **Map Fields:** HighLevel will prompt you to map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “First Name” in the CSV to “First Name” in HighLevel.  

  * **Assign Tags and Lists:** During the import process, you can assign contacts to specific lists and apply tags. Consider applying a tag that indicates the source of the contacts, such as “Imported from ActiveCampaign.  

  * **Complete Import:** After mapping all fields and setting tags/lists, click Import. HighLevel will process the import, and the contacts will be added to your account.

### **_Step 4:  _**_Review Imported Data_

  * After the import is complete, review the data in HighLevel to ensure all contacts and associated fields have been imported correctly.

    **Field Mapping Tip:**  Ensure all required fields are correctly mapped. If a field in your CSV does not have a corresponding field in HighLevel, you may need to create a custom field in HighLevel before proceeding.

* * *

# **Migrate Deals (Opportunities)**

Deals (referred to as Opportunities in HighLevel) represent potential sales or transactions. Migrating deals involves exporting deal data from ActiveCampaign and importing it into the appropriate pipeline in HighLevel.

### **_Step 1:  _**_Export Deals from ActiveCampaign_

  * **Access Deals:** In ActiveCampaign, navigate to the Deals section via the left-hand menu.  

  * **Filter Deals:  **Use filters at the top of the Deals page to narrow down the deals you wish to export. You can filter by status (Open, Won, Lost), pipeline, and other criteria.  

  * **Initiate Export:  **Click the Export button, typically located in the gear icon menu at the top right.  

  * **Download CSV:  **The system will generate a CSV file containing the deal data. Download this file for use in HighLevel.

### **_Step 2:  _**_Prepare CSV for HighLevel Import_

  * **Review Required Fields:  **Ensure that each deal has a corresponding contact in the HighLevel system. The CSV should include fields such as Deal Title, Value, Pipeline, Stage, Contact Name, and Deal Owner.  

  * **Data Consistency:** Confirm that the data is consistent, especially for fields like Pipeline and Stage, which must align with the structures in HighLevel.

### **_Step 3:  _**_Import Deals into HighLevel_

  * **Navigate to Opportunities** : In HighLevel, go to Opportunities via the left-hand menu.  

  * **Start Import Process:** Click the Import Opportunities button.  

  * **Upload CSV File:** Select and upload the CSV file.  

  * **Map Fields:** Map the CSV fields to the corresponding fields in HighLevel. For example, map “Deal Title” to “Opportunity Title.”  

  * **Pipeline and Stage:** Ensure that each deal is assigned to the correct pipeline and stage within HighLevel.  

  * **Complete Import:** After mapping the fields, click Import. The deals will be added to the specified pipeline in HighLevel.

### **_Step 4:  _**_Post-Import Check_

  * After import, review the opportunities in HighLevel to ensure all deals have been accurately imported, including their stage and assigned owner.

* * *

# **Migrate Email Templates**

Email templates are pre-designed emails used in campaigns and automations. These can be transferred from ActiveCampaign to HighLevel using a share link.

### **_Step 1:  _**_Share Email Template from ActiveCampaign_

  * **Access Email Templates:** Navigate to Campaigns > Campaign Templates in ActiveCampaign.  

  * **Locate Template:** Find the template you wish to migrate.  

  * **Generate Share Link:** Hover over the template, click the gear icon, and select Share. A window will appear with a share link. Copy this link.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Import Email Template into HighLevel_

  * **Navigate to Email Templates:** In HighLevel, go to Marketing > Emails > Email Templates.  

  * **Start Import Process:** Click Create New Template and select Import Template.  

  * **Paste Share Link:** Paste the ActiveCampaign template share link into the provided field.  

  * **Name the Template:** Give the template a name in HighLevel and click Create Template.

### **_Step 3:  _**_Post-Import Check_

  * After importing, review the template in HighLevel. Make any necessary customizations to align with your branding and campaign needs.

* * *

# **Recreate Landing Pages**

Landing pages are standalone web pages designed to capture leads or promote specific offers. While HighLevel does not support direct import of landing pages, they can be manually recreated using HighLevel’s page builder.

### **_Step 1:  _**_Document Landing Page Details_

  * **Export Content:** Review the landing page in ActiveCampaign and note down its structure, content, and any tracking codes (e.g., Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel).  

  * **Take Screenshots:** Capture screenshots of the landing page layout for reference during the rebuild process.

### **_Step 2:  _**_Rebuild Landing Page in HighLevel_

  * **Navigate to Page Builder:** In HighLevel, go to Sites > Funnels/Websites.  

  * **Create New Page:** Select Create New Funnel/Website and choose a template or start with a blank page.  

  * **Recreate Structure:** Using HighLevel’s drag-and-drop builder, recreate the structure of the ActiveCampaign landing page. Add the content, images, and forms as needed.  

  * **Add Tracking Codes:** Go to Settings > Tracking Codes and add any necessary tracking codes (e.g., Google Analytics ID, Facebook Pixel).  

  * **Customize and Publish:** Customize the page’s theme, layout, and SEO settings. Once satisfied, click Publish.

### **_Step 3:  _**_Post-Publish Check_

  * Ensure all links, forms, and tracking codes work correctly on the published page.

* * *

# **Migrate Forms**

Forms are used to collect information from leads and trigger automations. Forms from ActiveCampaign need to be recreated in HighLevel’s form builder.

### **_Step 1:  _**_Document Form Details_

  * **Review Form Fields:** In ActiveCampaign, note down the form fields, actions (e.g., add to list, apply tag), and any integrations.  

  * **Capture Form Settings:  **Document any specific settings, such as form visibility, custom CSS, or conditional logic.

### **_Step 2:  _**_Recreate Forms in HighLevel_

  * **Navigate to Form Builder:  **In HighLevel, go to Sites > Forms.  

  * **Create New Form:** Click Create New Form and start adding fields that match those from the ActiveCampaign form.  

  * **Configure Actions:  **Set up form actions such as adding contacts to a list, applying tags, or triggering workflows in HighLevel.  

  * **Embed Form:  **Once the form is built, you can embed it on a HighLevel landing page or website by copying the embed code.

### **_Step 3:  _**_Post-Implementation Check_

  * **Test Form Submission:** Submit a test entry through the form to ensure that all actions (e.g., adding to lists, applying tags) are working correctly.  

  * **Verify Data Capture:** Check that the form data is captured accurately in HighLevel, including any custom fields or tags.  

  * **Review Embedded Forms:** If the form is embedded on a landing page or website, ensure it displays correctly across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

* * *

# **Recreate Automations**

Automations in ActiveCampaign are sequences of actions triggered by specific events (e.g., form submission, tag application). Migrating automations involves manually recreating these workflows in HighLevel using its Workflows feature.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Document ActiveCampaign Automations_

  * **Export Automation Details:** If possible, export a visual representation or detailed breakdown of each automation from ActiveCampaign. If this is not available, manually document the triggers, actions, conditions, and end goals of each automation.  

  * **Identify Key Elements:** For each automation, identify key components such as entry triggers (e.g., contact added to a list), actions (e.g., send email, add tag), and any conditional logic (e.g., if/else branches).

### **_Step 2:  _**_Recreate Automations in HighLevel_

  * **Access HighLevel Workflows** : In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.  

  * **Create New Workflow:  **Click Create New Workflow and start by setting the entry trigger that matches the one in ActiveCampaign (e.g., form submission, tag added).  

  * **Add Actions and Conditions:  **Recreate the sequence of actions from the ActiveCampaign automation. This may include sending emails, adding/removing tags, updating contact records, or moving deals through a pipeline.  

  * **Use Conditional Logic:** HighLevel allows you to add conditional logic similar to ActiveCampaign’s if/else branches. Ensure that these conditions are correctly set up to guide contacts through different paths based on their behavior or attributes.  

  * **Configure Timing:** If the automation involves timed delays (e.g., wait for 1 day), ensure these are set up accurately in HighLevel.

### **_Step 3:  _**_Test and Validate_

  * **Run Test Contacts:** Create a test contact or use a segment of existing contacts to run through the newly created workflow. Monitor the process to ensure all actions are executed correctly.  

  * **Check Workflow Reports:** After the test run, review the workflow reports in HighLevel to verify that the automation is performing as expected.  

  * **Adjust as Necessary:** If any part of the workflow does not behave as intended, make adjustments and re-test until the automation is functioning smoothly.

* * *

# **Additional Migration Considerations**

### ** _Training and Documentation_**

  * **Internal Training:** Provide training for your team on how to use HighLevel effectively, especially focusing on differences from ActiveCampaign.
  * **Create Internal SOPs:  **Document any internal processes that have changed as a result of the migration to HighLevel.

### **_Data Integrity_**

  * **Double-Check Data:** After all components have been migrated, double-check that all data (contacts, deals, email templates, etc.) has been transferred accurately and is complete.  

  * **Backup Data:** Ensure you have backups of all original data from ActiveCampaign before deleting or archiving it.

### **_Customer Communication_**

  * **Notify Contacts:** If the migration impacts your customer-facing processes (e.g., changes to email templates or form submissions), consider notifying your contacts about the transition to avoid confusion.

### **_Ongoing Monitoring_**

  * **Monitor Performance:** Regularly monitor the performance of workflows, email campaigns, and other automated processes in HighLevel to ensure they are working as intended.  

  * **Optimize:** Use HighLevel’s analytics and reporting tools to identify areas for optimization post-migration.
