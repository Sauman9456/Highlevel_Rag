## Overview

Now we have an action in the workflows that can be used to conduct A/B testing. Send your contacts through multiple paths and check which one gets the better results.

## Action Name

Split Action

## Action Description

**Split action is a powerful tool designed to empower your marketing and sales automation strategies. With Split, you can d****ivide your contacts into multiple paths based on a random distribution according to the selected percentage, allowing you to test different variations of your workflow and identify the best performing one.**

## Action Details

  1. **Add the Split action** to your workflow by clicking on the "+" icon to add an action and selecting "Split" from the "Internal Tools" category.

**      **2\. The Split action screen will open.

** **      3\. Choose **"Random Split"** from the Distribution Type dropdown.

**      **4.**  Customize your paths:**

  * Change the default "Path A" and "Path B" names to your desired variations.
  * Set the percentage of contacts you want to send to each path (total must equal 100%).  

   5\. Add upto 5 paths and remove a path by clicking on "X" icon next to the path you want to delete.

####   

####    6\. Click on the "Statistics" icon to check how many contacts have entered which path.

#### 

####   

####   

7\. Stats will also be visible in the workflow if the "Stats View" is tuned on.

## Example

The distribution in random split is totally random just like rolling a dice is random. 

**Imagine you have 100 customers entering a workflow.** You've set up a Random Split with two paths: **Path A** and **Path B** , each with a **50% chance** of receiving a customer. This split is like flipping a coin: each path has an equal chance of being chosen for each customer.

**Here's how the distribution might look:**

  * **Customer 1:** Flips heads, goes to **Path A**.
  * **Customer 2:** Flips tails, goes to **Path A  **(again).
  * **Customer 3:** Flips heads, goes to **Path B**.
  * **Customer 4:** Flips tails, goes to **Path B** (again).
  * **Customer 5:  **Flips tails, goes to Path B (again).
  * **Customer 6:  **Flips tails, goes to Path A.  
  
This pattern continues randomly, with each customer having a chance of going to either path, **regardless of previous choices**.
