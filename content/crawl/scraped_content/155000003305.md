## Action Details

#### Step-by-Step Guide

  1. **Choose the Action Type:**

     * Select "Custom Webhook" from the list of available actions in the workflow builder.
  2. **Name Your Action:**

     * Enter a descriptive name, such as "Send Data to External API."
  3. **Enter the Webhook URL:**

     * Provide the URL of the external system’s endpoint where the data should be sent (e.g., a CRM, payment gateway, or custom API).
  4. **Select HTTP Method:**

     * Choose from POST, GET, PUT, or DELETE depending on the type of data operation required by the external service.
  5. **Select Authorization Method (Optional):**

     * Choose the necessary authorization method such as API keys, Bearer Tokens, or Basic Auth to ensure secure communication with the external service.
  6. **Configure Headers & Query Parameters (Optional):**

     * Add any required headers like `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` or content-type headers to define the data format (`Content-Type: application/json`).
     * Use query parameters to pass additional information, filter data, or adjust the external API’s response.
  7. **Map Data:**

     * Insert relevant data (e.g., contact name, email, phone number) into the request body. You can structure the payload in JSON or another format required by the external system. Example Payload:

    { "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}", "last_name": "{{contact.last_name}}", "email": "{{contact.email}}", "phone": "{{contact.phone}}" }

JavaScript

  1. **Save and Activate the Workflow:**

     * Once set up, activate the workflow. The webhook will trigger and send data in real time based on the workflow conditions.

## Example

**Scenario:** A business wants to send contact information to an external CRM whenever a new lead is created in your system.

  1. **Create Workflow Trigger:**

     * Set up a workflow trigger for when a new lead is created.
  2. **Add Custom Webhook Action:**

     * Choose "Custom Webhook" and name it "Send Lead Data to CRM."
     * Webhook URL: `https://api.externaltestcrm.com/leads/create`
     * HTTP Method: POST
     * Payload
        
                {
          "first_name": "{{contact.first_name}}",
          "last_name": "{{contact.last_name}}",
          "email": "{{contact.email}}",
          "phone": "{{contact.phone}}"
        }

     * Headers: Add an API key to authenticate the request
       * `Authorization: Bearer xyz123`
       * `Content-Type: application/json`
  3. **Test the Webhook:**

     * Test using a tool like Webhook.site or Postman to confirm the data is correctly sent and received.
  4. **Save and Activate:**

     * Once activated, the webhook will automatically send lead data to the CRM whenever a new lead is created.

**Outcome:** Every new lead  is synced with the external CRM, improving automation and reducing manual data entry.
