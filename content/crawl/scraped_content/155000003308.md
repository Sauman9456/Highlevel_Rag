# **Migrate Users**

Calendly Supports multiple users in a Calendly Organization(think of this as an Agency level.) Each user gets their own Calendly account and individual Calendly page, along with event types you assign to their account.

Admins and Owners of Calendly organizations can download a list of organization members in their Calendly organization which shows the following for every member. This list will help us ensure the users are added to the HighLevel subaccount. 

### **_Step 1:  _**_Export a list of Calendly Users_

  * **Log in to Calendly:** At the top right corner of any Calendly page, select Account > Users. Select Export. A CSV file will be downloaded.

### **_Step 2:  _**_Add and Assign Users to the HighLevel Subaccount_

  * **Log in to HighLevel:** Go Agency Settings > Team. Verify users in Calendly are added and assigned to the HighLevel Subaccount.  

  * Use the \+ Add Employee to add missing users. Use the calendly export to determine the user's role.

* * *

# **Migrate Calendar Configurations**

Calendly syncs availability Google Calendar, Outlook, and iCloud calendars to ensure that events are scheduled based on user availability. HighLevel offers a similar feature to prevent double bookings.

### 

    **IMPORTANT:** Perform the following steps for each user you're migrating.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Disconnect Google Calendar from Calendly_

  * **Connect Google Calendar and Outlook:** Select Google and follow the prompts to sign in and connect your calendar. HighLevel will check for conflicts based on your availability in Google Calendar.  

  * **Set Sync Preferences:** Go to Calendars > Calendar Settings > Connections. Configure whether you want HighLevel to sync cancellations and other preferences similar to what was set in Calendly.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Test Calendar Sync:** Schedule a test event in Google and verify that it appears as blocked in Highlevel Calendars and that any other existing busy events in Google Calendar are respected in HighLevel Calendars.

* * *

# **Migrate Availability Settings**

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Verify Availability:** Check the calendar in HighLevel to confirm that available times match what was set in Calendly and that buffer times and other restrictions are correctly applied.

* * *

### **_Step 1:_**_  Disconnect Zoom from Calendly_

  * **Access Integrations:** In Calendly, go to Integrations > Zoom.  

  * **Disconnect Zoom:** Follow the steps to disconnect your Zoom account from Calendly.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Connect Zoom to HighLevel_

  * **Connect Zoom:** Select Zoom and sign in to your account. Authorize HighLevel to access your Zoom account.  

  * **Set Zoom as Default Location:** In your calendar settings in HighLevel, set Zoom as the default location for your appointments if applicable.

* * *

# **Configure Payment Collection**

All event types in Calendly support payments.

Guide the customer on creating additional locations to support connecting multiple Stripe accounts.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Disconnect Stripe from Calendly_

  * **Log into Calendly:** To disconnect Stripe from your Calendly account completely, visit the Integrations page, select the option for Stripe and click Disconnect.

# **Migrate Calendars (Event Types)**

In Calendly, calendars are referred to as Event Types. These are used to schedule meetings, collect payments, and gather additional information from contacts. In HighLevel, similar functionality is achieved through its appointment scheduling system.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Document Event Types_

  * **List Event Types:** In Calendly, identify and document each event type you’ve created, including its name, duration, location, and associated settings.  

  * **Note Specifics:** Include details like buffer times, minimum notice, daily limits, and any custom fields used for gathering additional information from invitees.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Event Types in HighLevel_

  * **Access Calendars in HighLevel:** Navigate to Calendars > Calendar Settings in HighLevel.  

  * **Create New Appointment Type:** Select Create New Calendar to start setting up a new appointment type.  

  * **Configure Appointment Details:** Set the name, duration, location (Date-Specific Hours), and other settings such as buffer times, minimum notice, and daily limits. Add Team members to Calendars. This corresponds to the Event Type settings in Calendly.  

  * **Custom Fields:** If your Calendly event types collected additional information (e.g., questions or forms), [click here to learn how to recreate these as custom fields in HighLevel Forms.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003223)

### **_Step 3:_**_  Share Scheduling Links_

  * **Generate and Share Link:** After setting up each appointment type, generate the corresponding scheduling link in HighLevel. Share these links with your team or embed them in your website and emails, replacing the old Calendly links.

### **_Step 4:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Test Booking Process:** Ensure that the booking process works as expected by performing a test booking through the new HighLevel appointment link. Verify that all settings (e.g., buffer times, form questions, notifications, Zoom link) function correctly.

* * *

# **Migrate Workflows (Automations)**

Calendly workflows automate tasks such as sending reminder emails or follow-up messages. HighLevel offers similar automation capabilities through its Workflows feature.

### **_Step 1:  _**_Document Existing Workflows_

  * **Review Workflows in Calendly:** From your [Calendly home page](https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me)[](https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me)**[](https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me)**, select[Workflows](https://calendly.com/app/workflows/user/me)[](https://calendly.com/app/workflows/user/me)**[](https://calendly.com/app/workflows/user/me)**from the navigation panel on the left-hand side. Document the workflows you have set up in Calendly, including triggers (e.g., event creation, event cancellation) and actions (e.g., send email, send SMS).

### **_Step 2:  _**_Recreate Workflows in HighLevel_

  * **Access Workflows:** In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.  

  * **Create New Workflow:** Select Create New Workflow and set up the conditions and actions that match those documented from Calendly. Use HighLevel’s trigger options to start the workflow based on similar events (e.g., appointment booked, appointment canceled, appointment no show).  

  * **Customize Messages:** Customize any email or SMS messages that are part of the workflow, using HighLevel’s variables for personalization.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Test Workflow Execution:** Create a test appointment and observe whether the workflows trigger as expected. Ensure that messages are sent at the correct times and with the correct content.

* * *

# **Migrate Contacts**

Before fully transitioning, it’s essential to export appointment data from Calendly, which hold contact information, to ensure nothing is lost during migration.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Export Event Details_

  * **Filter Events in Calendly:  **In Calendly, filter events to show the ones you need to export (e.g., past 30 days, specific event types). On your [Home page](https://calendly.com/event_types/user/me), select Meetings.  

  * **Export to CSV:  **At the top right of the Scheduled Events page, select Export to download event details in a CSV format. This file will include invitee contact information, event types, dates, locations, and more.

# **Additional Migration Considerations**

### ** _Training and Support_**

  * **Internal Training:** Provide training sessions for team members on how to use HighLevel, focusing on features that differ from Calendly.  

  * **Access Support:** Ensure that the client's team knows how to access HighLevel’s support resources for any scheduling-related questions. 

### **_Migrate Other Apps_**

  * **Calendly is a single feature:** Are there more tools in the client tech stack? Use our software guides to help the client migrate other software.
