# **Preparation for Migration**

###  _**Step 1:** Review Current Skool Setup_

  * **Identify Key Assets:** Catalog all essential elements, including community members, courses, content, events, and automation workflows currently used within Skool.  

  * **Assess Data Volume:** Determine the size and complexity of the data to be migrated, including the number of courses, members, and community posts.

### _**Step 2:** Define Migration Objectives_

  * **Set Clear Goals:** Define the primary reasons for migrating to HighLevel, such as better CRM integration, advanced marketing automation, or a more unified platform.  

  * **Prioritize Features:** Identify the critical components for migration, focusing on community engagement, course content, and member management.

### _**Step 3:** Prepare Backup_

  * **Export Data from Skool:** Export all relevant data (members list, courses, community content) from Skool as CSV files or other applicable formats.  

  * **Backup Documentation:** Securely store all exported files and related documentation to ensure data safety before starting the migration process.

* * *

# **Data Migration**

###  _**Step 1:** Export Data from Skool_

  * **Export Members:** In Skool, navigate to the Members section and use the export function to download the member list as a CSV file, including names, emails, and any custom fields.  

  * **Export Courses:** Download course content, including video links, descriptions, and resources, ensuring all course materials are saved for re-upload to HighLevel.  

  * **Export Community Content:** Manually copy or export important community posts, discussions, and pinned content that needs to be recreated in HighLevel.

### _**Step 2:** Import Data into HighLevel_

  * **Import Members:** In HighLevel, go to Contacts > Import Contacts and upload the CSV file exported from Skool. Ensure all fields are correctly mapped during the import process.  

  * **Recreate Courses:** Navigate to the Courses section in HighLevel, and create new courses by uploading the previously exported content, including videos, descriptions, and resources.  

  * **Rebuild Community Content:** Use HighLevel’s community tools to recreate important discussions, posts, and other content. Pin essential posts or announcements using the Featured Posts feature.

* * *

# **Rebuilding Community and Courses**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Set Up Community Channels in HighLevel_

  * **Create Channels:** In HighLevel, create new channels for each community or discussion group that was present in Skool. Customize the channel settings, including privacy options and access levels.  

  * **Invite Members:** Send out invitations to all community members via email or unique invite links. Use the Contacts > Send Email feature in HighLevel to streamline this process.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate and Organize Courses_

  * **Set Up Course Structure:** Use HighLevel’s course creation tools to structure courses similarly to how they were organized in Skool. Create sections and modules as needed, and upload all relevant content.  

  * **Assign Course Access:** Set access permissions for each course, ensuring that only the appropriate members can access specific content, mimicking the access controls previously set in Skool.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Manage Member Roles and Permissions_

  * **Assign Roles:** Assign roles such as Admin, Moderator, or Contributor to members in HighLevel, ensuring that the community hierarchy and permissions are preserved.  

  * **Set Up Member Permissions:** Configure member permissions to control access to specific channels, courses, and community features based on the roles assigned.

* * *

# **Rebuilding Events and Automations**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Recreate Events in HighLevel_

  * **Set Up Event Calendar:** Use HighLevel’s calendar feature to recreate events that were scheduled in Skool. Set up recurring events and ensure that all relevant members are invited.  

  * **Configure Event Notifications:** Set up automated email and SMS reminders for events to ensure high member participation, leveraging HighLevel’s communication tools.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Rebuild Automation Workflows_

  * **Create Automation Flows:** In HighLevel, navigate to Automations > Workflows to recreate Skool’s automation processes, such as welcome messages, course completion notifications, and event reminders.  

  * **Test Automations:** Run tests on the newly created automation workflows to ensure they function correctly, making adjustments as necessary.

* * *

# **Testing and Validation**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Test Community and Course Functionality_

  * **Perform End-to-End Testing:** Simulate member interactions, such as joining channels, accessing courses, and participating in discussions, to ensure everything functions as intended.  

  * **Validate Data Integrity:** Cross-check imported data, such as member lists, course content, and community posts, to confirm that everything is accurate and accessible.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Validate Event and Automation Setups_

  * **Run Test Scenarios:** Test each event and automation workflow to verify that triggers and actions work correctly, ensuring a smooth experience for all members.  

  * **Verify Communication Channels:** Ensure that all communication actions, including emails and SMS, execute properly within the workflows.

* * *

# **Team Training and Transition**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Train Team Members_

  * **HighLevel Training:** Conduct training sessions to familiarize team members with HighLevel’s interface, especially focusing on community management, course setup, and automation tools.  

  * **Provide Documentation:** Distribute user guides and SOPs tailored to HighLevel’s functionalities to support team members during the transition.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Monitor and Optimize_

  * **Monitor System Performance:** Regularly review the performance of community engagement, course completion rates, and automation effectiveness post-migration.  

  * **Optimize Workflows:** Adjust workflows and community structures based on team feedback and operational needs.

* * *

# **Decommissioning Skool**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Transition Period_

  * **Run Systems in Parallel:** Consider running Skool and HighLevel in parallel for a brief period to ensure a smooth transition for members and administrators.  

  * **Phase Out Skool:** Gradually reduce reliance on Skool as confidence in HighLevel grows and all members have successfully transitioned.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Cancel Skool Subscription_

  * **Final Backup:** Ensure all necessary data is backed up before canceling the Skool subscription.  

  * **Official Cancellation:** Follow Skool’s process to cancel your subscription and terminate any associated services.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Review_

  * **Review Success:** Assess the success of the migration, documenting any challenges and resolutions for future reference.  

  * **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continue to monitor HighLevel’s performance, making necessary adjustments to optimize community and course management.
