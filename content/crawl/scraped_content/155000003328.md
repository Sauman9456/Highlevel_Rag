## Overview

The **  Goal Event** enables you to set specific milestones within a workflow. When a contact meets the defined goal, this action can automatically adjust the workflow by skipping certain steps, moving the contact to in the workflow as complete. From the moment a contact enters the workflow, the system will "listen" for the specified Goal Event to occur regardless of the contact's step.

## Action Name

 Goal Event

## Action Description

The Goal Event action allows you to define and track specific objectives within a workflow. When a contact achieves the goal, the system can automatically move them to a designated step, skip actions, or end the workflow. This feature helps streamline processes by focusing on key objectives, ensuring contacts are handled appropriately based on their interactions.

Supported Goal Events:

  * **Email Events:** Such as opened, clicked, unsubscribed, etc.
  * **Trigger Link Clicks:** Detects when a contact clicks a specific link.
  * **Contact Tags:** Reacts when tags are added or removed from a contact.
  * **Appointment Status:** Tracks changes in appointment statuses like new, confirmed, or showed.

## Action Details

#### Step-by-Step Guide

  1. **Choose the Action Type:**

     * Select "Goal Event" from the list of available actions within the workflow builder.
  2. **Name Your Action:**

     * Enter a descriptive name, such as "Lead Conversion Goal."
  3. **Select the Goal Event:**

     * Choose the type of event that will trigger the goal. Supported events include:
       * **Email Events:** Such as when a contact opens, clicks, or unsubscribes from an email.
       * **Trigger Link Click:** When a contact clicks a specific link in your communications.
       * **Contact Tags:** When a specific tag is added or removed from a contact.
       * **Appointment Status:** When an appointment status changes to new, confirmed, or showed.
  4. **Define the Goal Criteria:**

     * Specify the exact conditions that need to be met for the goal to be achieved. For example, if using email events, you might set the goal to trigger when a contact clicks a specific email link.
  5. **Determine Workflow Response:**

     * Decide what should happen when the goal is met:
       * **Move to Next Step:** Continue the workflow from the next defined action.
       * **Skip Steps:** Bypass certain actions and move directly to a specified step.
       * **End Workflow:** Conclude the workflow if the goal is the final objective.
  6. **Handle Unmet Goal Conditions:**

     * Choose how to proceed if a contact reaches the goal step without meeting the goal:
       * **End the Workflow:** Stop the workflow entirely.
       * **Continue Anyway:** Proceed with the workflow even if the goal is unmet.
       * **Wait Until Goal is Met:** Pause the workflow until the contact meets the goal.
       * **Save and Activate:**

         * After configuring the goal and its responses, save and activate the workflow to start monitoring contacts as they progress toward the goal.

## Example

**Scenario:** A business wants to trigger follow-up actions when a contact schedules an appointment.

  1. **Create Workflow Trigger:**

     * Set up a workflow that tracks contacts as they progress through various stages, such as lead nurturing.
  2. **Add Workflow Goal Action:**

     * Name the action "Appointment Confirmed Goal."
     * Select the "Appointment Status" event and set the goal to trigger when the status is "Confirmed."
  3. **Set Workflow Response:**

     * Once the appointment is confirmed, have the workflow skip to a sequence that sends a confirmation email and prepares the necessary follow-up actions.
  4. **Save and Activate:**

     * Once active, the workflow will monitor contacts for appointment confirmations and adjust their journey accordingly.**  
**  

  5. **Outcome:** Contacts who confirm appointments are automatically moved to the next step in the workflow, ensuring timely follow-ups and reducing manual management.
