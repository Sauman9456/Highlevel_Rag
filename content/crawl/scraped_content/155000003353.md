## Overview

The **Update Custom Value** action allows you to dynamically change the value of a pre-defined custom value within a workflow. This action is useful when you want to modify information like contact details, system settings, or personalized fields on the fly during workflow execution.

#### 

## Action Name

**Update Custom Value**

## Action Description

This action updates an existing custom value with a new one. Custom values can be used throughout workflows to create dynamic content, personalize messages, or control logic based on specific criteria. The action allows for replacing the current value with a new value within your workflow's context.

## Action Details

### **How to Configure the Action**

  1. **Add the Action to Workflow** : Drag and drop the **Update Custom Value** action into your desired workflow.
  2. **Select Custom Value** : From the dropdown, select the specific custom value that you wish to update.
  3. **Current Value** : This field will automatically display the current value of the selected custom value (if applicable).
  4. **New Value** : Enter the new value that you wish to replace the existing one. You can input a static value or use dynamic variables (like user or contact information) depending on your workflow needs.

### **Some Suggested Triggers (But not limited to)**

  * **Contact Tag Added**

    * **Use Case** : When a new tag is added to a contact (e.g., "VIP", "High Priority"), you can update a related custom value to reflect the importance of that contact.
    * **Example** : If the "VIP" tag is added, update the custom value for **Discount Rate** to offer a higher percentage.
  * **Contact Updated**

    * **Use Case** : Trigger the action when specific contact fields are updated. For example, if a customer’s preferences or contact information changes, you can update a corresponding custom value.
    * **Example** : If the **Email Subscription** field is updated to "Subscribed", update a custom value **Email Frequency** to "Weekly".
  * **Form Submitted**

    * **Use Case** : After a form submission, you can update custom values based on the data provided in the form.
    * **Example** : A form submission triggers the workflow to update the custom value **Survey Score** or **Preferences**.
  * **Appointment Booked**

    * **Use Case** : After an appointment is successfully booked, you can update custom values based on the type of appointment or other related criteria.
    * **Example** : When a contact books a high-ticket appointment, update the **Appointment Importance** custom value to “High”.
  * **Opportunity Status Changed**

    * **Use Case** : When the status of an opportunity changes in the pipeline (e.g., from "Qualified" to "Won"), you can update a custom value that helps manage customer expectations.
    * **Example** : If the opportunity status changes to "Won", update the custom value **Client Tier** to "Platinum".
  * **Survey Submitted**

    * **Use Case** : When a contact submits a survey, their responses can be used to dynamically update custom values that inform future interactions.
    * **Example** : If a customer survey response indicates a high satisfaction score, update a custom value **Customer Satisfaction** to reflect that score.
  * **Order Fulfilled**

    * **Use Case** : After an order is fulfilled, you can update the contact's custom value to track their order history or customer status.
    * **Example** : When an order is fulfilled, update the custom value **Last Order Date** to the current date.
  * **Link Clicked**

    * **Use Case** : When a contact clicks a link in an email or SMS, the workflow can dynamically update a custom value based on their behavior.
    * **Example** : If a link for a new product is clicked, update a custom value **Product Interest** to reflect the interest in the clicked product.

##   

## Example

  * **Trigger** : Contact Tag Added
    * **Condition** : A tag "VIP" is added to a contact.
    * **Action** : Update Custom Value
      * **Custom Value** : Discount Rate
      * **Current Value** : 10%
      * **New Value** : 15%

In this example, when the "VIP" tag is added to a contact, the discount rate custom value is updated from 10% to 15%, enabling the contact to receive a higher discount during future interactions.
