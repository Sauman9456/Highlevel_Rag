## Overview

The **Drip** action in workflows allows you to control the flow of contacts through your workflow by sending them to the next step in batches, at specified intervals. This is particularly useful when you want to stagger communication, such as sending emails or SMS in manageable batches, or ensuring resources aren't overwhelmed by too many contacts at once.

## Action Name

**Drip**

## Action Description

The **Drip Mode** allows you to proceed to the next workflow step in batches at regular intervals, allowing you to stagger the execution and manage resource usage efficiently. Contacts will move through the workflow according to the batch size and time interval set.

## Action Details

### How to Configure:

  1. **Action Name** : Provide a unique, descriptive name for the action such as “Staggered SMS Drip.”
  2. **Batch Size** : Set the number of contacts that will proceed to the next step at a time (e.g., if you set 100, the system will process 100 contacts at a time).
  3. **Drip Interval** : Choose the frequency at which each batch will move to the next step. The options are:
     * **Minutes**
     * **Hours**
     * **Days**

For example, you can set a batch of 100 contacts to proceed every 10 minutes.

Field Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Batch Size| Defines how many contacts will move forward in each batch.| Yes  
Drip Interval| Set the time interval (minutes, hours, days) for each batch.| Yes  
  
##   

## Example

**Scenario** : You have 1,000 contacts you want to send an email to, but you don't want to send them all at once to avoid overwhelming your email server.

  * **Batch Size** : 100
  * **Drip Interval** : 1 hour

In this setup, 100 contacts will receive the email every hour until all 1,000 have received it.

**Scenario** : Sending promotional SMS to a list of contacts without flooding your SMS provider.

  * **Batch Size** : 50
  * **Drip Interval** : 10 minutes

Every 10 minutes, 50 contacts will receive the SMS, distributing the load evenly across the campaign duration.

## Additional Notes

  * **Resource Management** : Drip Mode is especially useful to prevent bottlenecks and manage resource limitations, such as API request limits or server capacities.
  * **Precise Control** : By adjusting the batch size and time intervals, you can finely control the flow of contacts through the workflow.
  * **Optimization** : Ideal for large-scale marketing campaigns or resource-constrained operations where you want to avoid overwhelming communication channels (e.g., email or SMS providers).
