## Overview

The "**Remove Opportunity** " action removes an opportunity associated with a contact in a specific pipeline. This is useful when an opportunity is no longer relevant or needs to be deleted for any reason. You can select the pipeline from which the opportunity will be removed, ensuring that you are managing your opportunities effectively.

## Action Name

****Remove Opportunity****

## Action Description

This action deletes an opportunity associated with the contact within a specified pipeline. Once the opportunity is removed, it will no longer be visible or tracked in the selected pipeline.

## Action Details

### How to Configure

  1. **Action Name:** Set the action name (e.g., "Remove Opportunity").
  2. **Pipeline:** Select the appropriate pipeline from which you want to remove the opportunity.

## Field Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Pipeline| The pipeline from which the opportunity will be removed| Yes  

## Example

If a contact is no longer interested in proceeding with a business deal or a project has been canceled, you can use this action to automatically remove their opportunity from the pipeline, ensuring your pipeline remains up to date with only active opportunities.

###   

## Suggested Triggers

Here are some suggested triggers to pair with the "Remove Opportunity" action:

  1. **Tag Added** : When a tag indicating disinterest or project cancellation is added to the contact, automatically remove their opportunity from the pipeline.
  2. **Form Submission** : If a customer submits a form indicating they are no longer interested, use this trigger to remove the opportunity.
  3. **Appointment Cancelled** : If a key appointment related to the opportunity is canceled, the opportunity can be removed from the pipeline automatically.
  4. **Opportunity Status Change** : If the opportunity is moved to a "Lost" status, the workflow can trigger this action to remove the opportunity entirely.

###   

## Additional Notes

  * Use this action to keep your pipelines clean and free from irrelevant or outdated opportunities.
  * Once an opportunity is removed, it cannot be recovered, so use this action carefully.
