## Overview

The "**Google Adwords** " action allows you to fire a conversion event in Google Ads. This action is useful for tracking conversions that result from your marketing efforts, helping you measure the effectiveness of your Google Ads campaigns.

## Action Name

****Google Adwords****

## Action Description

This action sends conversion events to your Google Ads account, allowing you to track specific actions (like purchases, signups, or form submissions) that are directly tied to your ads. You can define the conversion event that should be triggered based on certain actions in your workflow.

## Action Details

Field Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Conversion| The specific conversion event you want to trigger in Google Ads| Yes  

### How to Configure

  1. **Action Name** : Set the action name (e.g., "Add to Google Adwords").
  2. **Conversion** : Select the conversion event you want to track in Google Ads from the dropdown menu. Ensure the conversion is set up in your Google Ads account before selecting it here.

## Example

If you're running a Google Ads campaign to drive form submissions, you can trigger a "Lead Form Submission" conversion event when a user submits a form. This helps track how effective your ad is in generating leads.

###   

## Suggested Triggers

  * **Form Submission** : Trigger this action when a form is submitted to track conversions in Google Ads.
  * **Appointment Booked** : Use this action to track when appointments are booked as a conversion.
  * **Product Purchase** : Track product purchases as a conversion event in Google Ads.
  * **Link Clicked** : Trigger the conversion event when a specific link is clicked, indicating user engagement from your ad.
  * **Page Visit** : Track visits to specific pages (e.g., "Thank You" or "Confirmation" pages) as conversion events in Google Ads.

###   

## Additional Notes

  * Ensure your Google Ads account is properly configured to receive conversion data.
  * The conversion event must be set up in Google Ads prior to using this action in your workflow.
  * This action will help you optimize ad spend by measuring the effectiveness of your campaigns.
