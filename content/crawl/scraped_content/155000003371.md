## Overview

The **Connect Call (IVR)** action allows you to transfer an ongoing call to another phone number, user, or agent. This can be useful for routing calls to specific departments, agents, or external phone numbers in a call center or IVR system. Additionally, the action allows advanced settings like voicemail detection, call recording, timeout, and time limits for connected calls.

## Action Name

**Connect Call (IVR)**

## Action Description

The **Connect Call (IVR)** action provides functionality to transfer an ongoing call from the IVR system to another phone number or user. You can choose multiple users to call in parallel and set custom numbers. This action also supports advanced features such as detecting voicemail, recording calls, and setting timeout and time limits for the connected call.

## Action Details

### **How to Configure:**

  1. **Action Name** : Provide a name for the action, such as "Transfer to Agent" or "Connect to Sales Department".

  2. **Connect Call To** : Specify the user or custom phone numbers where the call should be transferred. You can select up to 10 users to call simultaneously.

  3. **Advanced Settings** :

     * **Detect Voicemail** : Enable this feature if you want to detect if the call goes to voicemail. Enabling this option may introduce a small delay.
     * **Record Call** : Toggle this setting to record the transferred call for later review.
     * **Timeout (Seconds)** : Set the number of seconds to wait for the called party to answer the call (e.g., 30 seconds).
     * **Time Limit (Seconds)** : Set the maximum duration of the connected call. For example, if you want the call to automatically disconnect after 1 hour, you would set this to 3600 seconds.
