## Overview

The **Task Notification** action allows you to create a new task with a defined due date that will be assigned to a specific user. This is particularly useful for ensuring team members are aware of tasks that need their attention.

## Action Name

**Task Notification**

## Action Description

This action creates a task within the system, assigns it to a user, and defines a due date by which the task must be completed. You can specify task titles, assign users, set descriptions, and establish deadlines, ensuring task management is easy to organize.

## Action Details

### **How to configure:**

  1. **Action Name:** Give the task an appropriate name such as "Add Task" to reflect its purpose.
  2. **Title:** Enter the task title that will be visible to the user.
  3. **Description:** Provide detailed information about the task. This is what the user will see to understand their assignment.
  4. **Assign To:** Select the user or team member to whom the task will be assigned.
  5. **Due In:** Define the deadline for the task using predefined durations (e.g., 1 day, 2 days, or immediate).

##   

Field Name| Description| Mandatory  
---|---|---  
Title| Title of the task to help users identify it.| Yes  
Description| Detailed description of the task, providing context and guidance to the assigned user.| No  
Assign To| Select the user to whom the task will be assigned from the available list of users.| Yes  
Due In| Set the deadline for the task (e.g., in 1 day, 2 days, 5 days, or "Now" for immediate tasks).| Yes  
  
##   

## Example

Let’s say you want to assign a task to a team member, John, to follow up with a lead. You can configure the action as follows:

  * **Action Name:** Add Task
  * **Title:** Follow-up with Lead XYZ
  * **Description:** Call Lead XYZ and check on the progress of their onboarding process.
  * **Assign To:** John Doe
  * **Due In:** 2 Days

In this case, John will receive the task in the system, and it will be due within 2 days.
