# **Preparation for Migration**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Review Current HubSpot Setup_

  * **Document Existing Workflows:** Record details of existing workflows, pipelines, and campaigns that need to be replicated in HighLevel.  

  * **Assess Data Volume:  **Evaluate the amount of data (e.g., contacts, deals, emails) to be migrated, ensuring you have adequate storage and resources in HighLevel.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Define Migration Goals_

  * **Set Clear Objectives:  **Define what you aim to achieve with the migration, such as improved automation, better CRM integration, or cost savings.  

  * **Prioritize Features:** Prioritize which features and data sets are most critical to migrate first.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Prepare Backup_

  * **Export Data from HubSpot:** Export all necessary data from HubSpot, including contacts, companies, deals, tickets, workflows, and other essential records.  

  * **Backup Data:** Ensure you have a secure backup of all data before beginning the migration process.

* * *

# **Migrate CRM Data**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Export Data from HubSpot_

  * **Contacts and Companies:** Navigate to Contacts > Contacts and CRM > Companies. Export data as CSV files.  

  * **Deals and Pipelines:** Go to Sales > Deals. Export your pipelines and associated deals.  

  * **Marketing Assets:** Export emails, landing pages, forms, and workflows.  

  * **Products and Invoices:** Export your product catalog and any invoices generated through HubSpot’s payment tool.

### _**Step 2:** Import Data into HighLevel_

  * **Import Contacts and Companies:**
    * In HighLevel, navigate to Contacts > Import Contacts.
    * Upload the CSV files exported from HubSpot, mapping fields appropriately (e.g., first name, last name, email).  

  * **Recreate Deals and Pipelines:**
    * Set up new pipelines in HighLevel under Opportunities > Pipelines.
    * Manually recreate deals or import them if necessary.  

  * **Migrate Products and Invoices:**
    * Recreate product listings in HighLevel under Payments > Products.
    * Set up invoices and payment links using HighLevel’s invoicing tool.

* * *

# **Migrate Workflows and Automations**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Review Existing HubSpot Workflows_

  * **List Active Workflows:** Identify and document all active workflows in HubSpot, including triggers, actions, and delays.  

  * **Evaluate Workflow Complexity:** Assess the complexity of each workflow to determine the best approach for replicating it in HighLevel.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Workflows in HighLevel_

  * **Create Automation Triggers:**
    * In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.
    * Set up triggers equivalent to those in HubSpot (e.g., form submissions, contact updates).  

  * **Rebuild Actions and Delays:** Recreate actions such as sending emails, SMS, tagging contacts, or updating deal stages. Configure any necessary delays and conditional logic within workflows.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Test Workflows_

  * **Run Tests:** Before activating workflows, run tests to ensure they function as intended.  

  * **Adjust Settings:** Make necessary adjustments based on test results to ensure smooth operation.

* * *

# **Migrate Marketing Campaigns**

    * Recreate or import your email templates and configure them to match your existing designs.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Rebuild Landing Pages and Forms_

  * **Export Landing Pages:** Download the HTML for HubSpot landing pages.  

  * **Rebuild in HighLevel:**
    * Use HighLevel’s Sites > Landing Pages builder to recreate landing pages.
    * Ensure all forms and CTA buttons are linked to your HighLevel workflows.

### **Step 3:** Campaign Settings

  * **Configure Campaigns:** Set up your campaigns in HighLevel, ensuring that all assets (emails, landing pages, forms) are linked. Assign specific goals, budgets, and tracking settings as needed.

* * *

# **Migrate Communication Tools**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Migrate Calling and SMS_

  * **Twilio Integration:** If using Twilio in HubSpot, integrate it with HighLevel for calling and SMS. Go to Settings > Phone Numbers in HighLevel to set up your Twilio account.  

  * **Configure Communication Workflows:** Set up SMS and call automation workflows in HighLevel under Automation > Workflows. Ensure all client communication is appropriately logged and tracked.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Setup Conversations Inbox_

  * **Configure Inbox:** In HighLevel, navigate to Conversations > Inbox. Set up your default inbox and connect communication channels such as email, SMS, and Facebook Messenger.  

  * **Test Communication Channels:** Ensure all channels are functioning correctly and that messages are properly routed to the appropriate inbox.

* * *

# **Final Checks and Training**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Perform Final Data Validation_

  * **Cross-Check Data:** Ensure that all data has been successfully migrated and that there are no discrepancies between HubSpot and HighLevel records.  

  * **Validate Workflows and Campaigns:** Confirm that all workflows, automations, and campaigns are operational.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Train Team Members_

  * **HighLevel Training:** Provide training to your team on how to use HighLevel, focusing on the differences from HubSpot.  

  * **Utilize HighLevel Support:** Encourage team members to leverage HighLevel’s support resources and community forums for ongoing learning.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Monitor and Optimize_

  * **Monitor Performance:** Track the performance of your new setup in HighLevel, making adjustments as necessary.  

  * **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and refine workflows, automations, and campaigns to ensure they align with business goals.

* * *

# **Decommissioning HubSpot**

### ** _Step 1:_**_  Transition Period_

  * **Run in Parallel:** Consider running HubSpot and HighLevel in parallel during the transition phase to ensure no critical operations are missed.  

  * **Gradual Phase-Out:** Gradually reduce reliance on HubSpot as HighLevel becomes fully operational.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Cancel HubSpot Subscription_

  * **Final Data Backup:** Before canceling your HubSpot subscription, ensure all data is securely backed up.  

  * **Official Cancellation:** Follow HubSpot’s process to cancel your subscription and terminate services.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Review_

  * **Review Success:** Evaluate the success of the migration process and document any lessons learned.
