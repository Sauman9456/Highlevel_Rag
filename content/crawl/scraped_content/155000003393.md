# **Migrate Visual Automations**

ConvertKit uses Visual Automations to create email funnels and automated workflows. In HighLevel, these are managed through the Workflows feature, which offers similar, if not more advanced, automation capabilities.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Document Visual Automations_

  * **List Automations:** In ConvertKit, document each visual automation, including the entry points (triggers), actions, events, and conditions.  

  * **Capture Automation Flow:** Take screenshots or notes on the specific flow of each automation to ensure accuracy when recreating it in HighLevel.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Automations in HighLevel_

  * **Access Workflows:** In HighLevel, go to Automation > Workflows.  

  * **Create New Workflow:** Click Create New Workflow and start setting up the workflow to replicate the automation from ConvertKit.  

  * **Set Entry Points (Triggers):** Use HighLevel’s trigger options to match the entry points from ConvertKit (e.g., form submission, tag added, purchase made).  

  * **Add Actions and Conditions:** Recreate the actions and conditions (e.g., send email, wait steps, if/else branches) to mirror the original automation flow.  

  * **Test the Workflow:** Once built, test the workflow in HighLevel to ensure all triggers, actions, and conditions work as expected.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Run a Test:** Set up a test contact to run through the workflow and verify that all steps function correctly, including email sends, tagging, and conditional branches.

* * *

# **Migrate Subscribers (Contacts)**

Subscribers in ConvertKit are equivalent to contacts in HighLevel. Migrating subscribers involves exporting them from ConvertKit and importing them into HighLevel, including their tags and segmentation.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Export Subscribers from ConvertKit_

  * **Navigate to Subscribers:** In ConvertKit, go to Subscribers > Grow.  

  * **Select All Subscribers:** Click the checkbox at the top to select all subscribers. If you have more than 30 subscribers, make sure to confirm by clicking the link in the blue bar that appears.  

  * **Export Subscribers:** Choose Bulk Actions > Export to initiate the export. The file will be emailed to the account owner or can be downloaded directly from ConvertKit.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Import Subscribers into HighLevel_

  * **Navigate to Contacts:** In HighLevel, go to Contacts > Import Contacts.  

  * **Upload CSV File:** Upload the CSV file you exported from ConvertKit.  

  * **Map Fields:** Map the fields from the CSV to the appropriate fields in HighLevel (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Email, Tags).  

  * **Segment and Tag Contacts:** Use the tagging and segmentation information from ConvertKit to recreate similar segments and tags in HighLevel.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Verify Import:** Review the imported contacts in HighLevel to ensure that all data has been correctly mapped and segmented.

* * *

# **Migrate Forms**

Forms in ConvertKit are used for lead capture and subscriber management. HighLevel’s form builder allows you to recreate these forms with additional integration into your CRM and automation workflows.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Document Form Details_

  * **List Forms:** In ConvertKit, document the forms you have created, including their fields, design, and settings such as redirect URLs, incentive emails, and reCAPTCHA.  

  * **Capture Custom Fields:** Note any custom fields used in the forms for data collection.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Forms in HighLevel_

  * **Access Form Builder:** In HighLevel, navigate to Sites > Forms.  

  * **Create New Form:** Click Create New Form and start by adding the fields used in your ConvertKit forms.  

  * **Customize Design:** Adjust the design elements such as background colors, fonts, and button styles to match the original forms.  

  * **Set Form Actions:** Configure form actions like redirecting after submission, sending a confirmation email, and applying tags.  

  * **Integrate with Workflows:** If the form triggers a workflow, ensure it is integrated with the corresponding HighLevel workflow.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Test Form Submissions:** Submit a test entry through each form to verify that the data is correctly captured and triggers the appropriate workflows.

* * *

# **Migrate Landing Pages**

ConvertKit’s landing pages are standalone pages used for lead generation. HighLevel allows you to recreate these landing pages with enhanced integration into your overall marketing strategy.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Document Landing Page Details_

  * **List Landing Pages:** In ConvertKit, document each landing page, including the template used, content, custom images, and any integration with forms or automations.  

  * **Capture Custom Domain Settings:** Note if any landing pages use a custom domain or subdomain.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Landing Pages in HighLevel_

  * **Access Landing Page Builder:** In HighLevel, go to Sites > Funnels/Websites and choose Create New Landing Page.  

  * **Select Template:** Choose a template that matches the layout and style of your ConvertKit landing page.  

  * **Rebuild Content:** Recreate the content, images, and design elements on the HighLevel landing page.  

  * **Set Up Forms:** Embed the forms created in HighLevel into the landing page and ensure they are correctly linked to workflows and contact lists.  

  * **Configure Domain Settings:** If you used a custom domain in ConvertKit, configure the same domain or subdomain in HighLevel.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Preview and Test:** Preview the landing page and run a test to ensure that all elements work as expected, including form submissions and redirects.

* * *

# **Migrate Email Broadcasts**

Email broadcasts in ConvertKit are similar to HighLevel’s email campaigns. You can recreate these broadcasts in HighLevel to continue your email marketing efforts.

### **_Step 1:  _**_Document Email Broadcasts_

  * **List Broadcasts:** Document the email broadcasts you have sent in ConvertKit, including the subject lines, email content, and recipient segments.  

  * **Capture Email Templates:** Save copies of any email templates used in ConvertKit broadcasts.

### **_Step 2:  _**_Recreate Email Broadcasts in HighLevel_

  * **Access Email Campaigns:** In HighLevel, go to Marketing > Email Campaigns.  

  * **Create New Campaign:** Click Create New Campaign and set up the email broadcast, replicating the content and design from ConvertKit.  

  * **Segment Recipients:** Use the imported tags and segments to define the recipient list for the broadcast.  

  * **Schedule or Send:** Choose whether to send the broadcast immediately or schedule it for a later time.

### _**Step 3:** Post-Migration Check_

  * **Send Test Email:** Send a test email to verify the design and content, ensuring it renders correctly across different email clients.

* * *

# **Migrate Commerce Features**

ConvertKit offers tools for managing digital products and subscription payments. HighLevel’s payment integration features allow for similar functionality, integrated with its broader marketing and CRM capabilities.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Document Commerce Products_

  * **List Products:** Document all digital products or subscriptions you have set up in ConvertKit, including pricing, fulfillment methods, and any associated automations.  

  * **Capture Product Details:** Record the URLs, custom domains, and settings for each product.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Commerce Products in HighLevel_

  * **Access Payments & Order Forms:** In HighLevel, navigate to Sites > Order Forms to set up new product pages or order forms.  

  * **Set Product Pricing:** Recreate the pricing models used in ConvertKit, including one-time payments, subscriptions, and payment plans.  

  * **Configure Fulfillment:** Set up digital product delivery or subscription management, ensuring customers receive their products automatically upon purchase.  

  * **Integrate with Workflows:** Link the product purchase to workflows for follow-up emails, upsells, or customer segmentation.

### _**Step 3:** Post-Migration Check_

  * **Test Purchase Flow:** Perform a test purchase to ensure the payment is processed correctly, and the product is delivered as intended.

* * *

# **Export Data from ConvertKit**

Before fully transitioning, it’s essential to export any critical data from ConvertKit, such as subscriber lists and engagement metrics, for reference or import into HighLevel.

### **_Step 1:_**_  Export Subscriber List_

  * **Navigate to Export:** In ConvertKit, go to Subscribers > Grow and select Export under the Bulk Actions menu.  

  * **Receive Export File:** The export file will be sent via email or can be downloaded directly from your ConvertKit account.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Review Exported Data_

  * **Verify Data Integrity:** Open the exported CSV file to ensure all necessary information has been captured accurately, including subscriber details, tags, engagement metrics, and any custom fields. This data can be used to inform your strategy within HighLevel or for backup purposes.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Import Data into HighLevel (Optional)_

  * **Import Additional Data:** If necessary, you can import additional data (beyond subscribers) into HighLevel, such as tags, engagement scores, or custom field data that was exported from ConvertKit.  

  * **Set Up Additional Data Fields:** Ensure that any custom fields or unique data types from ConvertKit are correctly mapped and recreated within HighLevel.

### **_Step 4:_**_  Post-Migration Check_

  * **Cross-Check Data:** After the import, cross-check the data within HighLevel to ensure that all subscriber information and tags have been accurately imported and that there are no discrepancies.

* * *

# **Additional Considerations**

### ** _Training and Support_**

  * **Internal Training:** Provide training sessions for your team on how to use HighLevel effectively, with a focus on features that differ from ConvertKit. This may include understanding HighLevel’s CRM capabilities, multi-channel marketing options, and automation workflows.  

  * **Access Support:** Ensure your team knows how to access HighLevel’s support resources and documentation to assist with any issues that may arise during or after the migration.

### **_Ongoing Monitoring_**

  * **Monitor Performance:** Regularly monitor the performance of your email campaigns, automations, and landing pages within HighLevel to ensure they meet your expectations and perform as well or better than in ConvertKit.  

  * **Optimize Settings:** Use HighLevel’s reporting and analytics tools to identify areas for improvement, such as email deliverability, automation effectiveness, and lead conversion rates.

### **_Backup and Data Retention_**

  * **Keep Backups:** Retain a backup of your ConvertKit data even after the migration is complete. This ensures that you have access to historical data in case of discrepancies or for future reference.  

  * **Data Retention Policies:** Review your data retention policies in HighLevel to ensure they align with your business needs and compliance requirements.
