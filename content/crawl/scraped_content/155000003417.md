    2. You will be able to manage your WhatsApp profile from the WhatsApp Business App, and not from the CRM
    3. You can only have maximum of one phone number under coexistence

# How Contacts and Conversation will be synced

#   

The synchronization process for your chats and contacts typically takes between 4 to 6 hours to complete. The exact duration depends on the volume of data being transferred, specifically:

  1. The number of chat conversations in your history
  2. The total number of contacts in your WhatsApp Business account

Once the synchronization is complete:

  * Your chat conversations will be accessible under the 'Conversations' tab in the GoHighLevel CRM.
  * Your contacts will be listed under the 'Contacts' tab.

Please note that the synchronization time may vary slightly based on network conditions and the current load on our servers. During this period, it's important to keep your WhatsApp Business App open and ensure your device maintains a stable internet connection to facilitate a smooth data transfer.

    Important: During the synchronisation process, please ensure:
    
    1. Your WhatsApp Business App remains open and active on your device.
    2. Your device maintains a stable internet connection throughout the process.
    
    These steps are crucial for a successful and uninterrupted data transfer

    Contacts synced from the WhatsApp Business App will have created by WhatsApp

# How will WhatsApp Conversation Charges Work

  1. Messages sent from WhatsApp Business App:
     * These messages will remain free, just as they are today.
     * They will not be counted towards CloudAPI/partner integrity limits or caps based on trust tiering.
  2. Messages sent from Cloud API:
     * These messages will be charged based on the existing API pricing model.
     * They will go through API messaging enforcement based on trust tiering, as is currently the case.

Message Source| Charges| Integrity Limits/Caps| Trust Tiering  
---|---|---|---  
WhatsApp Business App| Free| Not counted| Not applicable  
Cloud API| Charged (existing pricing model)| Counted| Applicable  

The key principle is that the integration of Cloud API solutions for WhatsApp Business App users maintains the existing pricing structure:

  * The WhatsApp Business App continues to offer free messaging.
  * The Cloud API platform charges for messages based on its current pricing model.

This approach allows businesses to benefit from both the free messaging of the WhatsApp Business App for simpler, one-to-one communications, and the more advanced features of the Cloud API for larger-scale or automated messaging, while maintaining clear separation in terms of pricing and enforcement.

It's designed for WhatsApp businesses who primarily use the WhatsApp Business App and are looking for advanced tools to manage conversations at scale or integrate complex needs such as payments, shipping, and leads management.

## Q. Is there a limit on the number of marketing messages a Coexistence business can send on Cloud API?

The limit would follow the existing Messaging Limits. In addition, please note that you are not required to complete Business Verification in order to unlock a higher messaging limit than 250 business-initiated conversations in a 24-hour moving period. Open 1,000 or more business-initiated conversations in a 30-day moving period using templates with a high quality rating rating. Once you reach this threshold, we will analyze your messaging quality to determine if your messaging activity warrants an increase to your messaging limit. Based on this analysis, we will then either approve or deny an increase. Businesses can increase their messaging limit from 250 to 1,000 and show their business’ display name.

## Q. Who is Coexistence Feature for?

WhatsApp businesses, who primarily use WhatsApp Business App today, and are looking for advanced tools from Partners to manage conversations at scale or to integrate complex needs such as payments, shipping, and leads management to optimize business outcomes.
