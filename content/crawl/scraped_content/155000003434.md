  * What's new?
  * How to use?
  * Why we built it?
  * Note:

## **What's new?**

  * Send out a document and view its entire history from sent, edited, viewed, to signed - just by clicking on view history on the options menu.
  * Hover on the contact icon and view the last viewed time and the actions that need to be done by the user.

## **How to use?**

  * Open Documents and Contracts
  * Scroll to the dashboard on the line item of the document that you want to know the status of
  * Hover on the customer icons
  * See the last action time, tags, status of all the users involved in the document
  * To view detailed logs, click on 3 dots and click on view history
  * View all the actions that happened on the document in the right drawer

## **Why we built it?**

  * Will help users to know the actual status of their documents on the go, without opening the document every time.
  * Will help them to get the document to a closure with readily available information.

## **Note:**

Last action time in the hover modal would only be available for the documents that are sent now onwards. For older documents the time won't be available.
