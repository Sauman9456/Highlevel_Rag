### **Overview**

By connecting your Microsoft Teams account, you can automatically generate dynamic meeting links, reducing manual steps. If you select Microsoft Teams as your meeting location in any calendar, a unique Teams link will automatically be generated for each new booking and sent along with the calendar invite.

* * *

### **Prerequisites**

You need access to the Microsoft Teams account you want to connect.

* * *

### **How to Connect Microsoft Teams**

There are two ways to connect your Microsoft Teams account:

  1. From the **"My Profile"** menu under the **Settings** tab.
  2. From the **"Calendars"** menu under the **Settings** tab.

**Steps to connect Microsoft Teams from the "My Profile" menu**

1\. Navigate to **Settings > My Profile**.

2\. Under **Video Conferencing** connections, click **Add New**.

3\. Select **Microsoft Teams** and click **Connect**.

4\. Sign in with your Microsoft Teams credentials.

5\. Your Microsoft Teams account is now successfully connected.

* * *

### **How to Add Microsoft Teams Links to Your Calendar**

After connecting your Teams account, you can add dynamic Teams links to your calendar. Here's how:

  1. Ensure your **Microsoft Teams** integration is successfully set up.
  2. Navigate to your **Calendar Settings  **and**  e****dit  **the calendar you want to modify.
  3. Go to the **Meeting Details** tab and scroll to the **Team Members** section.
  4. Choose the **team member** , ensure they have successfully **integrated** Microsoft Teams, then select Microsoft Teams as the meeting location and click **Save**.

### **Important Notes**

  * ### 

Connecting an Outlook calendar does not automatically link Microsoft Teams. To connect Teams, navigate to **Calendar Connections > Video Conferencing** and connect it separately.

  * To view appointments on your Outlook calendar, ensure that your desired Outlook calendar is both connected and selected as the linked calendar. You can do this under **Calendar Connections > Calendars**.

* * *

### **Limitations with Microsoft Teams Integration**

  * Only Microsoft Teams accounts for Work and School (Organisation and Education) are eligible for integration.
  * Each user can connect only one Microsoft Teams integration per subaccount.
  * The same Microsoft Teams integration can be used across multiple subaccounts, but only for the same user. For example, if User A has connected their Microsoft Teams integration in Subaccount A, then only User A can connect that same integration to Subaccount B.

* * *

### **FAQs**

**Q: Which Calendars Support Dynamic Microsoft Teams Links?**

A: **Personal Booking** , **Round Robin** , **Collective Calendars, and Service Calendars** support Microsoft Teams integration and automatically generate new Teams links for each appointment booked. This feature is coming soon for Class Booking Calendars.

**Q: How Can I Use Microsoft Teams with Event Calendars?**

A: You can use Microsoft Teams with **Event Calendars** by manually generating a Teams meeting link and adding it to the calendar settings.

**Steps:**

  1. Generate a meeting link in **Microsoft Teams**.
  2. In the calendar settings, select **Custom** as the meeting location.
  3. Paste the generated Teams link.

**Note** : This will add a static link, meaning the same link will be used for all future bookings.
