### **Overview**

You can now add and track notes for individual appointments. All notes related to an appointment are visible in the Appointment Modal, where you can see notes added by various users. Additionally, these notes are accessible in the Contacts & Conversations tab under the Notes section, helping you keep a detailed history of interactions for each appointment.

* * *

### **How to Add Notes to an Appointment**

  1. Go to the Appointment Modal.
  2. Navigate to the **Notes** tab.
  3. Click on **Add Note**.
  4. Type your note in the text box.
  5. Click **Save**.

The note will be saved with the name of the user who added it and the time it was created, providing a clear log of updates for each appointment.

* * *

### **Editing or Deleting Notes**

  * **Edit** : You can update any note by editing it.
  * **Delete** : You have the option to remove a note entirely if it's no longer needed.

* * *

### **Types of Notes in the Notes Section**

  1. **User-Added Notes** : Any notes manually added by users to the appointment.
  2. **Booker’s Additional Information** : If your calendar includes a default form, any data entered by the booker in the _Additional Information_ field during booking will be displayed in the appointment modal’s notes section (but not in the Contacts / Conversations tab). This ensures both the booker’s input and the user-added notes for that specific appointment are visible.
  3. **Synced Notes from Third-Party Calendars** : If your calendar is synced with third-party calendars like Google or Outlook (via two-way sync), any appointment descriptions or notes added in those calendars will also appear in the notes section of the Appointment Modal.

> **Important** : Notes added in the **Notes** section of the Appointment Modal are not synced to your Google Calendar invite. These notes are for internal system use only. However, any notes or descriptions added to Google Calendar will sync back to your system in HighLevel if two-way sync is enabled.
