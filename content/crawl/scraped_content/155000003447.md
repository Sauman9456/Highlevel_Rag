     * **Cancelled** : Appointments that were cancelled.
     * **Invalid** : Appointments that were marked as invalid for various reasons.
  4. **Date Added** : Filter by the date the appointment was originally created. This is helpful for finding recent bookings or tracking the influx of appointments over time.

  5. **Start Date / Appointment Time** : Use this filter to sort appointments by their scheduled start date and time. This is essential for tracking upcoming or past appointments within a specific time frame.

  6. **Created By** : Use this filter to find appointments based on who created them.

  7. **Is Rescheduled** : View appointments that have been rescheduled, allowing you to track changes and follow up as needed.
