# How to Enable and Rebill Domain Purchase?

Modified on: Wed, 25 Sep, 2024 at 3:28 AM

    - **Agencies on****Any Plan**** ** ($97, $970, $297, $2970, $497, $4970) can access Domain Purchase.  
      
    - Once Domain Purchase is enabled via the Agency settings, existing and new sub accounts will see an option to purchase domain
    
    - For agencies to avoid accruing execution costs for EXISTING Sub-Accounts, rebilling will need to be enabled _**manually**_ for each Sub-Account within the Agency view.
    
    - If Domain Purchase is **enabled** on the SaaS Configurator, new Sub-Accounts generated will _automatically_ be enrolled in Domain Purchase, _**no further**_ action is required by the agency.

####   

# **How to enable Domain Purchase at the Agency level?**

  * To enable **Domain Purchase** for your whole Agency (including all your Sub-Accounts), head into your **AgencyLevel** > **Settings** > **Company** > **Domain Purchase** and enable the toggle.  

  * Check the box "I confirm that I agree to the Domain Purchase terms." And then hit Enable.  

  * You can enable or disable the Domain Purchase feature or rebill for each Sub-Account in **Agency Settings > Domain Purchase**. You can access Sub-Account Settings only if Domain Purchase is enabled at the Agency Level.

        **Please Note:**

    **_Agencies on**Any Plan**_   ($97, $970, $297, $2970, $497, $4970) can access Domain Purchase.**

# **Domain Purchase Pricing**

  * Once Domain purchase is enabled, "Purchase a Domain" button will be shown in subaccounts "Domain Page"
  * Domain is chargeable for every domain purchase. The price of domain varies depending upon domain name and TLDs (like .com, .us, etc.)  

# **Re-billing the costs to your clients and making a profit**

**(only for 497 SaaS Agencies)**

Once you have enabled Domain Purchase in your agency account, it will be automatically enabled for all your clients to use. You can bill your clients at cost or add markup.

## **How to turn on re-billing for my clients?**

  1. Ensure you have enabled **Domain Purchase** for your Agency first. (see instructions)  

  2. If the sub-account isn't in SaaS Mode already, switch the sub-account into SaaS Mode by going into your **Agency account** > **Accounts tab  **> **Scroll to the sub-account** > Click the **three dots icon** and select "**Switch to SaaS.** "  [How to convert a location to SaaS](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001184920).  

  3. In **Agency account** > **Accounts tab** > Scroll to the **Sub-Account** > Click the **View Details  **link > Scroll to the **Domain Purchase** Re-Sell Settings section and toggle it on.  

  4. Use the slider to set the amount of markup you like to make and hit save!  

  5. Rinse and repeat for all your Sub-Accounts where you wish to rebill for usage.

# **How does re-billing work?**

  * Agencies pay HighLevel and get invoices with high-level branding
  * Sub-accounts (your clients) pay you (the agency) and get invoices with your branding. The money is deposited in your Stripe account connected to your agency level. [How do I connect my agency's Stripe account to collect client payments?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

This is very similar to other products that use re-billing or reselling models in the platform. Just like LC Phone or LC Email re-billing, re-billing of the Domain Purchase also utilizes "credits" from the agency wallet & the location wallet, respectively.
