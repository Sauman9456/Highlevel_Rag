# How to Pause or Cancel a Scheduled Email?

Modified on: Tue, 17 Sep, 2024 at 8:44 AM

With the new feature in our platform, you can now easily **pause** or **cancel** your scheduled email campaigns, including A/B tests. This functionality ensures you have full control over your campaigns, allowing you to make changes or corrections before they are sent.

####   
**What campaigns does it work for?**  
It works for all scheduled, batch schedule and A/B test campaign that was scheduled.   
  
**When to Use It:**

  * **Pause a Campaign:** Use this option if you need more time to review or make last-minute changes to your email campaign before it goes live. Pausing a campaign gives you the flexibility to resume it at any time.
  * **Cancel a Campaign:** Cancel a campaign if you decide not to send it at all. This is particularly useful if you spot critical errors or if the campaign is no longer relevant. Canceling a campaign stops all future sends, including any batches or automated RSS emails.

####   
  
**Steps to Pause or Cancel a Scheduled Email:**

  1. **Navigate to the Email Campaigns:**

     * Go to **Marketing** > **Email Marketing** > **Campaigns** in the platform's navigation menu.
  2. **Locate the Scheduled Campaign:**

     * Find the campaign you want to pause or cancel under the "Scheduled" status.
  3. **Open the Campaign Options:**

     * Click on the **three dots (menu icon)** next to the scheduled campaign.
  4. **Choose the Action:**

     * Select **Pause** to temporarily stop the campaign.
       * If resumed after the original scheduled time, the email will send immediately.
       * If resumed before the scheduled time, it will send as originally planned.
     * Select **Cancel** to completely stop the campaign. This will prevent it from being sent, including any RSS or batch emails.

By following these steps, you can easily manage your email campaigns, ensuring that you have time to correct any issues and make informed decisions before your campaign goes live.
