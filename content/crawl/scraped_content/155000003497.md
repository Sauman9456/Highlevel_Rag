## Overview

This allows you to automate tasks such as follow-ups or lead management processes based on the submission of LinkedIn forms.

## Trigger Name

## Trigger Description

This trigger initiates the workflow when a contact submits a LinkedIn Lead Form. You can also apply filters, such as **Business Niche** or **Page** , to refine the contacts that should enter the workflow based on additional criteria.

## How to Configure

  1. **Step 1:** Select **LinkedIn Lead Form Submitted** from the list of workflow triggers.
  2. **Step 2:** Name the trigger, such as "New LinkedIn Leads."
  3. **Step 3:** Add relevant filters:
     * For example, choose **Business Niche** and set the operator to **Is Not Empty** if you want to ensure the lead has a defined business niche.
     * Choose **Page** to specify the LinkedIn page where the lead form was submitted from.
  4. **Step 4:** Save the configuration and proceed to define the actions or steps to follow after the trigger fires.

> Please Note: This trigger would only work once you have integrated with LinkedIn on the platform. For this you can go to the Integrations tab and integrate LinkedIn

## Example

You want to capture all leads submitted through a specific LinkedIn page in the **Education** niche. Configure the trigger with:

  * **Business Niche** = **Is Not Empty**
  * **Page** = **Specific LinkedIn Page**

This ensures that any form submission meeting these conditions enters the workflow for follow-up actions like lead nurturing emails or a sales team alert.
