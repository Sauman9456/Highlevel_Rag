## How to Configure

  * **Select Trigger** : Start by choosing the _Funnel/Website PageView_ trigger from the list of available triggers in the workflow builder.

  * **Assign a Name** : Set a meaningful name for the trigger such as "Funnel Page Visit - Checkout."

  * **Filters** :

    * **Funnel/Website** : Select the specific funnel or website you want to monitor.
    * **Page** : Optionally, specify the exact page you want to track.
    * **UTM Parameters** : Set filters like UTM Campaign, Source, or Medium to refine the page view conditions.
  * **Add Multiple Filters** : You can add additional filters to monitor specific pages, paths, or UTM campaigns as needed by clicking on **Add filters**.

## Example

**Scenario** : You want to track when visitors reach the “Checkout” page of your funnel and then send them a follow-up email if they abandon their cart.

  * **Trigger** : Funnel/Website PageView
  * **Funnel/Website** : Funnel Name (e.g., Bookkeeper Funnel)
  * **Page** : Is equal to “Checkout”
  * **Action** : Send a follow-up email offering assistance after a specific amount of time if no purchase is completed.

This setup allows you to re-engage customers who might have dropped off at the final stage of purchasing.
