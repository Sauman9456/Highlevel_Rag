# Editing a countdown timer

Modified on: Thu, 19 Sep, 2024 at 6:14 AM

Editing a countdown timer is essential when you want to update its appearance, change its timing details, modify linked actions, or adjust its name. Here's a step-by-step guide on when and how to edit a countdown timer.

###   
**When Can You Edit a Countdown Timer?**

You can make changes to the countdown timer **only before** it has been used in an email campaign. Once the countdown timer has been included in an email that has been sent out, the only option left is to **archive** the timer. So, ensure all changes are made **before** sending any email that includes the timer.

###   
**What Can You Edit?**

  1. **Style Changes:**

     * You can change the appearance of the timer by adjusting the font, colors, and overall design to match your branding.
  2. **Timer Details:**

     * This includes modifying the time remaining, the end date, or any other time-related details to align with your campaign goals.
  3. **Dynamic Link Changes:**

     * You can update the dynamic link associated with the timer, which may redirect users to a different landing page or resource once the timer ends.
  4. **Naming:**

     * Adjust the name of the timer to keep things organized or to better reflect the purpose of the countdown.

###   
**How to Edit a Countdown Timer**

  1. **Go to Marketing Section:**

     * Navigate to the **Marketing** section of your dashboard.
  2. **Access the Countdown Timer:**

     * Look for the **Countdown Timer** option, where all your existing timers are listed.
  3. **Find and Select Your Timer:**

     * Search for the specific timer you want to edit. Once found, click on the **Edit** button.
  4. **Edit the Parameters:**

     * You can now modify anything,  like:
       * Style (fonts, colors)
       * Timer details (start/end time)
       * Dynamic links - Active or Expired
       * Timer name
  5. **Save Your Changes:**

     * Once you're done making the adjustments, be sure to click on **Save Changes** to apply them.
