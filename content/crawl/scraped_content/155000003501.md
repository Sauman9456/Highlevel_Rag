## **What is Ad Manager?**

An easy, simple to use platform to create, manage and analyse paid ads ideal to grown your business by increasing its visibility and reach to the masses.

Using our Ad Manager platform that supports Facebook Ads, you can generate new leads with simple ad creation and seamless syncing of leads or increase traffic on your website. It is an easy three step ad campaign creation process, all without leaving Ad Manager, right from connecting your Facebook account to publishing an ad campaign. 

##   

## **What are the two pricing plans for Ad Manager?**

There are two pricing plans namely "**Default Ad Manager** " and "**Connect-Your-Own Meta Business Manager** " out of which user needs to select any one to start using Ad Manager. 

    Selection of the pricing plan is the first step in the Ad Manager journey.

To select any one of the pricing plans, an agency admin needs to go to Agency view > Reselling and opt for either of the two plans.

    In order to learn more on how to resell Ad Manager, refer [How to Re-sell Ad Manager to your Clients](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002999-how-to-resell-ad-manager-to-your-clients)

  1. **Default Ad Manager:**  
  
Perfect for businesses whose ads are not currently being managed via Meta Business Manager - just create campaigns, set the budget, and publish! Agency can add between 0-15% markup on the ad spend budget and HighLevel will charge 10% of the remaining ad spend after your markup.  
System creates new child business manager under our own Business Manager and we automate the processes of UTMs/Conversion APIs. Clients will not have access to the business manager and all its assets.  

        **Note:  **Once a Facebook account is successfully connected to one location, a child BM is created which is associated to the connected FB account so even if you disconnect Facebook integration from that location, you will not be able to connect the same Facebook account with another location as a child BM already exists for that Facebook account.

  2. **Connect-Your-Own Meta Business Manager  ****:**  
  
Perfect for agencies already using Meta Business Manager who want to charge a flat monthly price to clients for Ad services. You pay a flat $97/month (or $970/year) to HighLevel for unlimited campaigns in all sub-accounts, you set a flat monthly price for your sub-accounts to pay in order to use Ad Manager or choose to offer as part of your SaaS plan.  
Under this option, you can connect your own Meta Ad account and have access to the associated business manager along with all the assets.
