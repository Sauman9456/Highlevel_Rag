# Additional Attributes to Online Listing Details

Modified on: Wed, 18 Sep, 2024 at 8:40 PM

We’re thrilled to announce a significant enhancement to our Online Listings integration — the addition of the Additional Attributes section in Listing Details! This update empowers businesses to showcase more detailed and specific information, making it easier for customers to find and connect with them.?

## **What’s New?**

The new Additional Attributes section introduces a variety of fields that allow businesses to capture and highlight their unique qualities, enhancing their overall profile and online presence.

## **Key Benefits for Business Owners:**

**Services:  **Clearly list the specific services your business offers, helping potential customers understand exactly what you provide. This transparency drives more relevant leads by matching customer needs with your offerings.

**Associations:  **Showcase your professional associations, organizations, or affiliations to build credibility and trust. By highlighting these connections, you position your business as a reputable leader in your industry.

**Brands:  **Specify the brands you carry or represent, giving customers important context about your product or service offerings. Recognizable brands can enhance customer confidence and trust.

**Languages:  **Indicate the languages spoken at your business to ensure effective communication with a diverse audience. This inclusivity not only improves customer satisfaction but also broadens your market reach.

**Keywords:  **Add relevant keywords that describe your business to improve online visibility. These keywords help potential customers find your business more easily, increasing traffic and the likelihood of discovery.

This update is designed to provide a richer, more detailed business profile that can attract the right audience and drive meaningful engagement. We’re excited to see how these new features will enhance your business’s online presence!
