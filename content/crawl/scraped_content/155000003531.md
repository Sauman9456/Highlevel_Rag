## Overview

The WhatsApp action allows you to send WhatsApp messages directly from a workflow. This feature is useful for creating dynamic, real-time communication with your customers through whatsapp. You can send manual messages or use pre-approved templates.

## Action Name

WhatsApp

## Action Description

The **WhatsApp Send Message** action enables the automatic sending of messages to customers via WhatsApp based on workflow triggers. This action can be configured to send free-form text messages within the 24-hour messaging window or pre-approved templates to initiate conversations outside the window. Particularly useful for reaching your audience, whether you're following up on inquiries, sending appointment confirmations, or delivering promotional content.

**Key Features:**

  * Send real-time WhatsApp messages directly from a workflow.
  * Use pre-approved templates for messages outside the 24-hour window.
  * Customize messages with dynamic variables (e.g., contact name, email).
  * Support for both business-initiated and customer-initiated conversations.

## Action Details

**Step-by-Step Guide  
**

  1. **Prerequisites:**

     * Ensure that WhatsApp is enabled and set up on your HighLevel account. For business-initiated conversations, ensure that you have approved WhatsApp message templates. You can refer to the [WhatsApp Subaccount Setup](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000001980) and [How to Create a WhatsApp Template](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000861) for more information.
  2. **Choose the Action Type:**

     * In your workflow builder, select "WhatsApp" from the list of available actions.
  3. **Name Your Action:**

     * Give the action a descriptive name, such as "Customer replied."
  4. **Select Message Type:**

     * **WhatsApp Template:** Choose a pre-approved template to send messages outside the 24-hour window.

  5. **Save and Activate:**

     * Save your action and activate the workflow to send WhatsApp messages to your contacts based on the defined triggers.

##### **Key Notes:**

  * **Free Entry Point Conversations:** Customers responding to a WhatsApp message open a Free Entry Point conversation, which allows you to send free-form or template messages for up to 72 hours at no additional cost.
  * **Do Not Disturb (DND):** You can set up DND for WhatsApp to manage customer communication preferences and respect those who opt out.

## Example

**Scenario:** A business wants to send appointment reminders via WhatsApp 24 hours before a scheduled meeting.

**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Appointment Reminder
  * **Action:** WhatsApp Send Message
    * **Name:** "Send WhatsApp Appointment Reminder"
    * **Message Type:** Template - Appointment Reminder
    * **Template Content:** "Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is a reminder for your appointment scheduled on {{appointment.date}}."

**Outcome:** The contact will automatically receive a personalized WhatsApp message reminding them about their upcoming appointment.
