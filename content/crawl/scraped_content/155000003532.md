# Help Guide: Redirection links in Countdown Timer

### **What Are Redirection Links?**

Redirection (dynamic) links change automatically based on whether the countdown timer is active or expired.

  * **Active Timer** : Users are sent to the live offer or event page.
  * **Expired Timer** : Users are sent to a different page (like an "Offer Expired" or "Waitlist" page).

###   
**Why Use Them?**

  * **Automatic Process** : No need to manually update links when offers end.
  * **Seamless User Experience** : Ensures users always go to the right page.
  * **Time-Saving** : It’s all automated.

###   
**Where to Access Redirection Links:**

  * **Countdown Timer** :

    1. Go to **Marketing** -> **Countdown Timer**.
    2. Click the **three dots** on your timer to copy the link.
  * **Email Builder** :

    1. Go to **Settings** in the Email Builder.
    2. Click **Copy Redirection Link**.  

  * **Funnels/ Websites/ Stores:  **In the page that has the timer element, the redirection to expired page is already configured. It is essentially working like a minute timer where the timer would not restart on every refresh and would redirect to the expiry page URL when the timer expires. 

###   
**How to Create a Timer with Redirection:**

  1. **Marketing** -> **Countdown Timer**.
  2. Set the **Active Link** (where users go before the timer expires).
  3. Set the **Expired Link** (where users go after the timer expires).
  4. Save the timer after selecting the timer properties like when would the timer expire.

Now your timer will automatically send users to the correct link, whether the offer is active or expired.
