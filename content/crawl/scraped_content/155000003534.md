## Overview

The **Payment Received** trigger automates actions based on incoming payments across the CRM, including one-time purchases, subscription charges, and invoice payments. This trigger helps businesses streamline their processes by automating tasks such as sending confirmation emails, updating records, or managing failed payments in real time. It can be customized with filters such as payment type, source, and transaction status to meet specific business needs.

## Trigger Name

Payment Received

## Trigger Description

The **Payment Received** trigger is designed to capture and act upon payment-related events within HighLevel workflows. Whether it's a successful transaction, a failed payment, or a subscription renewal, this trigger initiates automated actions such as sending notifications, updating subscription statuses, or engaging in dunning management. You can customize this trigger by filtering it based on payment source, product, transaction type, and payment status.

**Key Features:**

  * Captures all types of payments (one-time, subscription, invoices).
  * Supports real-time automation upon payment success or failure.
  * Customizable with filters (source, product, transaction status).
  * Automates responses such as sending receipts, notifications, or triggering follow-ups.

## How to Configure

##### **Step-by-Step Guide**

  1. **Add the Payment Received Trigger:**

     * In your workflow builder, select the **Payment Received** trigger from the list of available triggers.
  2. **Name Your Trigger:**

     * Provide a descriptive name for the trigger, such as "New Subscription Payment" or "Invoice Payment Received."
  3. **Apply Filters (Optional):**

     * You can make your trigger more specific by applying filters. Available filters include:
       * **Payment Source:** Funnel, website, invoice, Text2Pay links.
       * **Sub-Sources:** Select sub-sources like a one-step order form, two-step order form, or upsell.
       * **Transaction Type:** Choose between "Customer Present" (first transaction) or "Customer Not Present" (subscription/recurring).
       * **Payment Status:** Filter by successful or failed payments.
  4. **Use If/Else Conditions (Optional):**

     * You can further customize the workflow by adding If/Else conditions based on payment details. For example, send different emails depending on whether the payment was successful or failed.
  5. **Customize Actions Based on Payment Data:**

     * Use **Custom Values** from the payment data (e.g., amount, product name, payment method) to personalize the follow-up actions, such as sending confirmation emails, updating customer records, or notifying team members.
  6. **Save and Activate:**

     * Once you have configured your trigger and added any necessary filters, save and activate the workflow to start automating your payment-based processes.

## Example

**Scenario:** A business wants to automatically send a confirmation email when a customer successfully makes a payment for an online course.

**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Payment Received
    * **Name:** "Online Course Payment"
    * **Payment Source:** Funnel
    * **Payment Status:** Success
  * **Actions:**
    * Send a confirmation email to the customer with course access details.
    * Update the customer record in the CRM with the payment status.
    * Notify the sales team about the successful payment.

**Outcome:** When a customer successfully makes a payment via the two-step order form in the funnel, the workflow automatically sends them a confirmation email, updates their CRM record, and notifies the sales team.
