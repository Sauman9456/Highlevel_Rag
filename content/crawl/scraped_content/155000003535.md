## Overview

The **Order Submitted** trigger helps automate actions based on completed orders, whether from 1-Step or 2-Step order forms. This trigger allows businesses to upsell customers after an initial purchase and can fire based on primary purchases, bump offers, and upsells. It captures detailed order information, making it ideal for automating order confirmations, follow-ups, and upsell opportunities.

## Trigger Name

Order Submitted

## Trigger Description

The **Order Submitted** trigger captures order-related events, such as initial purchases, bump offers, and upsells. It automates post-purchase actions like sending confirmation emails, adding upsell offers, and updating customer records. The trigger works with both 1-Step and 2-Step order forms, offering flexibility based on product type or order details.

**Key Features:**

  * Works with 1-Step and 2-Step order forms.
  * Fires for both primary products and upsells.
  * Supports order-related custom values for better workflow customization.
  * Automates actions such as sending order confirmation emails or upselling after a purchase.

## How to Configure

## Step-by-Step Guide

  1. **Add the Order Submitted Trigger:**

     * In your workflow builder, select the **Order Submitted** trigger from the available options.
  2. **Name Your Trigger:**

     * Provide a descriptive name such as "Primary Product Purchase" or "Upsell Order Received."
  3. **Apply Filters:**

     * Use filters to target specific types of orders:
       * **Product Filters:** Set filters based on the product purchased (e.g., "Product A," "Bump Offer," "Upsell").
       * **Source Filters:** Specify if the trigger should fire based on the order source (funnel, page, etc.).
       * **Submission Type:** Choose between Primary, Bump, or Upsell for more precise targeting.
  4. **If/Else Conditions:**

     * Customize your workflow by adding conditions such as:
       * **Order Source:** Filter based on whether the order came from an order form or a funnel.
       * **Product or Price:** Use product-based conditions to determine the next steps in the workflow.
  5. **Use Custom Values:**

     * Incorporate custom values like product names, quantities, total order amounts, and payment gateways into your workflow actions for dynamic messaging.
  6. **Send Confirmation Emails (Optional):**

     * Use an email template with a **Shopping Cart** element to send a detailed order confirmation, including product images, quantities, and prices.
  7. **Save and Activate:**

     * Once you’ve configured your trigger and actions, save and activate the workflow to begin automating order-based actions.

## Example

**Scenario:** A business wants to automatically send an upsell offer after a customer submits an order for a primary product using a 2-Step order form.

**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Order Submitted
    * **Name:** "Primary Product Purchase"
    * **Submission Type:** Primary
    * **Order Source:** 2-Step Order Form
  * **Action:** Send a follow-up upsell email using a pre-configured email template.
  * **Additional Action:** Update the customer’s record with the product purchased and send an order confirmation.

**Outcome:** After a customer submits their order for the primary product, they receive an upsell offer, and their purchase is confirmed via email with all order details included.

#### **Filters and Conditions**

  1. **Filters Available:**

     * **Product:** Target specific products in the workflow.
     * **Submission Type:** Filter by Primary, Bump, or Upsell.
     * **Order Source:** Filter by funnel or order form.
     * **Payment Gateway:** Specify Stripe, PayPal, etc.
     * **Order Total:** Use numeric operators to trigger actions based on total order value.
  2. **If/Else Conditions:**

     * Use order-specific conditions such as product type, payment method, and order total to create conditional workflows that dynamically adjust based on the customer’s order details.
