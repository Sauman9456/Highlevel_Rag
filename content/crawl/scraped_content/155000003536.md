## Overview

The Subscription Trigger in GoHighLevel automates processes related to subscription status changes, enhancing workflow efficiency for businesses. This feature allows users to respond to key events in the subscription lifecycle.

##   

## Trigger Name

Subscription 

## Trigger Description

The Subscription Trigger activates workflows based on specific events such as:

  * Creation of a new subscription for a customer.
  * Transition of a subscription from trial to active status.
  * Cancellation of a subscription.

This trigger enables businesses to set conditions based on subscription status changes or associated products, utilizing custom values from the Payments section for tailored automation.

## How to Configure

  1. **Access Triggers:** Navigate to the Automations section in your GoHighLevel dashboard.
  2. **Create New Trigger:  **Click on "Add Trigger" and select "Subscription Trigger" from the list of available triggers.
  3. **Set Conditions:  **Define the conditions under which the trigger will activate, such as specific status changes or product associations.
  4. **Customize Actions:  **Choose actions that should follow the trigger activation, such as sending emails, updating records, or notifying team members.
  5. **Save and Activate:** Once configured, save the trigger and ensure it is activated for it to function as intended.

## Example

A common use case for the Subscription Trigger is automating customer communication. For instance, when a customer’s subscription transitions from trial to active, an automated welcome email can be sent to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. Similarly, if a subscription is cancelled, a follow-up email can be triggered to gather feedback or offer re-engagement incentives.
