## Overview

The Refund Trigger enables businesses to automate workflows related to payment refunds. This feature allows users to respond effectively to refund attempts, enhancing customer service and operational efficiency.

##   

## Trigger Name

Refund

## Trigger Description

The Refund Trigger activates workflows based on refund attempts processed by the business or sales agents. It allows users to set conditions based on various factors, including:

  * Success or failure of the refund.
  * Whether the refund is for the full amount or a partial amount.
  * Specific details regarding the amount or source of the refund.

This flexibility allows businesses to tailor their responses based on different refund scenarios.

## How to Configure

  1. **Access Triggers:** Go to the Automations section in your GoHighLevel dashboard.
  2. **Create New Trigger** : Click on "Add Trigger" and select "Refund Trigger" from the available options.
  3. **Define Conditions** : Set conditions for when the trigger should activate, such as:
     * Successful refunds.
     * Failed refunds.
     * Full or partial refunds.
  4. **Customize Actions** : Choose the actions that should follow the trigger activation, such as sending notifications, updating customer records, or creating follow-up tasks.
  5. **Save and Activate:** After configuration, save the trigger and ensure it is activated for it to function correctly.

Refund custom values are also available inside the Payments section in custom values to allow businesses to send customised notifications based on different scenarios

## Example

A practical use case for the Refund Trigger is automating customer notifications. For instance, if a refund is processed successfully, an automated email can be sent to inform the customer of the successful transaction. Conversely, if a refund fails, a different automated message can be triggered to notify the customer of the issue and provide further instructions. This ensures timely communication and enhances customer satisfaction during potentially frustrating situations.
