## Overview

The Group Access Granted trigger workflows allows for automated management of group access, enhancing community interactions and user experience.

## Trigger Name

Group Access Granted

## Trigger Description

The "Group Access Granted" action is triggered when a user is granted access to a specific group within a community. This automation ensures that users receive timely updates and can engage with relevant content and members.

## How to Configure

  1. **Navigate to the Workflow Builder:  **Access the Workflow Builder in your GoHighLevel account.
  2. **Create a New Workflow:**
     * Click on "Create a Workflow."
     * Select the relevant trigger type: "Group Access Granted."
  3. **Configure Trigger Details** :
     * Specify which group access is being granted.
     * Add any subsequent actions you wish to automate (e.g., sending welcome messages or notifications).
  4. **Test Your Workflow** : Ensure that the workflow operates as expected by testing it in a controlled environment.
  5. **Save and Activate** : Once confirmed, save your workflow and activate it for use.  

## Example

For instance, if a new member joins a book club community, you can set up a workflow that automatically grants them access to the "Book Discussions" group. This ensures they receive immediate updates about upcoming discussions and can engage with other members right away.
