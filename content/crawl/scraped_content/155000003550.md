# Adding Unassigned Calendars to Groups

Modified on: Fri, 20 Sep, 2024 at 2:21 PM

You can now assign Groups to the **Unassigned Calendar** type as well as other **Round-robin** Calendars

Go to **Settings > Calendars:**  
****

Click on the**3 dots** on the right side of the desired Calendar and then click on **Move to Group** :

It would open a pop-up where you would be asked to select a group you want to assign to the calendar and then Click on **Select**
