# SMS Restriction History

Modified on: Mon, 23 Sep, 2024 at 3:19 PM

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * SMS Restriction History
  * Enhancements
  * Bug Fixes

## **SMS Restriction History**

It helps you note and track any adverse action on their SMS sending, like 

  * Daily/Weekly sending limit violations
  * Warning Emails and Temporary restrictions based on 30007 and opt-out rate.

This option can be found under Location > Settings > Phone numbers > Advanced settings > Restriction history

## **Enhancements**

  * Number purchase flow > Search now supports blankspace and special characters as US based customers commonly use in their format
  * Earlier, if you called someone belonging to a location that was disabled, the call would get disconnected without any feedback. Now you will hear a voice describing the issue and the solution along with a tooltip on the UI
  * Recordings and transcriptions should now appear faster
  * We were already blocking certain keywords in SMS like 'cannabis'. We will now also block 'fireworks' and 'THC'

## **Bug Fixes**

  * SMS limit would sometimes not level up for users (ramp up model). This should now level up as expected
  * 'PR' (Puerto Rico) now shows up as a US state instead of a country for the A2P flow
  * After a sub-account transfer from one agency to another, the previous agency would get billed mistakenly. We have now fixed this issue
