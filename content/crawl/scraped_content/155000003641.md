## **Step-by-Step Guide to Creating an Affiliate Campaign**

### **Step 1: Start by Clicking the "Add" Button**

Navigate to the **Campaign** page and click the "+ Add" button to initiate the creation of your campaign.  

### **Step 2: Choose Your Campaign Source**

Select the source for your campaign, such as a funnel, website, or store where your products are listed.  

### **Step 3: Configure Source Details**

You can also choose the landing page where potential customers will land. Once set, the system will generate a default campaign URL. This URL includes a unique affiliate link, where the placeholder `<<affiliate_id>>` is automatically replaced with each affiliate's unique ID.

    **Please Note:**
    Currently, only funnels, websites, and stores support product sales via affiliate campaigns. However, you can also track leads and pay affiliates for generating leads through forms, surveys, and calendars. **[Learn more here.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003644-how-to-set-up-and-pay-affiliates-for-generating-leads)**
    
    Landing page selection is just used to set where the potentials customers will land. Please note that tracking will be done source wide not just on the landing page

### **Step 4: Review Your Product List**

Review the products associated with your selected source. Add or remove products to ensure that only commission-eligible items are listed.  

### **Step 5: Set Default Commission**

Establish a default commission for your campaign, choosing either a flat fee or a percentage of the product price.  

### **Step 6: Customize Product-Level Commissions (Optional)**

Optionally, set specific commissions at the product level to tailor payouts based on individual product prices.  

### **Step 7: Enable Multi-Tier Commissions**

Access the **Advanced Commissions** settings to enable multi-tier commissions. You can support up to 7 tiers for more intricate commission structures. [Learn more here.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003642)  

### **Step 8: Configure Tier-Specific Commissions**

Assign commissions to each tier by either applying the default rate or customizing them for each level based on performance.  

### **Step 9: Add a Campaign Description (Optional)**

Add a campaign description that outlines its purpose to make it more attractive to potential affiliates.  

### **Step 10: Assign Affiliates Directly**

Review affiliate details, such as their join date and total affiliate count, before directly assigning them to your campaign.  

### **Step 11: Adjust Additional Settings**

Tailor your campaign further with options such as:

  * Email templates for affiliate onboarding
  * Cookie duration for tracking affiliate activity
  * Payout terms
  * Including setup fees in commission calculations
  * Enabling sub-affiliate signups
  * Auto-enrolling new customers as sub-affiliates

### **Step 12: Publish or Save as Draft**

Once satisfied with your campaign setup, you can choose to **Publish** it immediately or **Save as Draft** for further editing.

**Congratulations!** Your affiliate campaign is now live and ready to drive results. With these intuitive tools, you’re equipped to grow your business and reward your affiliates for their contributions.
