## **Step-by-Step Guide: Track Leads in Affiliate Campaigns**

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Affiliate Campaign Page**

To get started, go to the **Affiliate Manager** under the Marketing tab. From there, click on the **Campaign Page** to manage your campaigns.

### **Step 2: Click on Add**

Once you’re on the Campaign Page, click the **‘Add’** button to create a new campaign for lead tracking.

### **Step 3: Choose Sources**

Select **Forms** , **Surveys** , or **Calendars** as the source for your campaign. These sources allow you to track leads generated through your affiliate's efforts seamlessly.

### **Step 4: Select Source Details**

Use the dropdown menu to specify the details of your selected source, whether it's a specific form, survey, or calendar you want to track.

### **Step 5: Review Default Affiliate Campaign URL**

Take a moment to review the **default affiliate campaign URL** generated for your campaign.

    _**Please Note:**_ 
    If no branded domain is added to the account, the affiliate campaign URL will default to the system domain. Users can add their own **branded domain** by navigating to **Settings > Business Profile > Branded Domain**. Once the branded domain is added, all affiliate campaign URLs will automatically update.

### **Step 6: Enable Pay Per Lead (Optional)**

If you want to reward your affiliates for every lead they generate, enable the **Pay Per Lead** option in the Commissions tab. For more details on how to enable Pay Per Lead, [learn more here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000003644).

### **Step 7: Optional Steps**

You can further customize the campaign by adding campaign descriptions, assigning affiliates, and adjusting any additional settings as needed.

### **Step 8: Publish the Campaign**

Once you’ve reviewed and finalized all your settings, hit the **‘Publish’** button to make the campaign live.

### **Step 9: Track Leads**

After the campaign goes live, leads will be automatically tracked under each affiliate's profile page. Navigate to the **Leads tab** to view the leads coming from forms, surveys, or calendars. You can use the **Source field** to identify the origin of each lead.

## **Important Notes for Effective Lead Tracking**

  * **Custom Embed/Iframes Are Not Supported:** Lead tracking will only work if forms, surveys, or calendars are added as components inside a funnel or webpage. Ensure these components are properly integrated into the funnel before using it as a source in your affiliate campaign.
  * **Branded Domain Requirement:** If you want your affiliate URLs to reflect your branded domain, you must add a branded domain in **Settings > Business Profile > Branded Domain**.

* * *

## **Conclusion: Optimize Your Lead Tracking for Better Campaign Results**

By following these steps, you’ll be able to seamlessly track leads from forms, surveys, and calendars in your affiliate campaigns. Automating this process not only saves time but also ensures that affiliates are accurately rewarded for their lead-generation efforts. With proper lead tracking in place, you’ll have more control over your affiliate campaigns, leading to better performance and results.

Make sure to implement these best practices in your next campaign and watch how automating lead tracking helps scale your affiliate efforts efficiently!
