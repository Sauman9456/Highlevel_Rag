# How to Add Affiliates in the Affiliate Manager

Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 5:21 AM

Affiliates are individuals or businesses that promote your products or services and earn commissions based on the sales or leads they generate. Using unique affiliate links, they track their promotions and are commonly referred to as "affiliate marketers" or "publishers."

Here are four simple ways to add and manage affiliates in your Affiliate Manager:

  * 1\. Add New Affiliate Manually
  * 2\. Upload Affiliates in Bulk
  * 3\. Import Affiliates from Contacts
  * 4\. Automate Affiliate Management Using Workflows

* * *

### 1\. **Add New Affiliate Manually**

  * Go to the Affiliate page and click the **"Add"** button.  

  * Choose **"New Affiliate"** from the options.  

  * Enter the affiliate's details and assign them to a campaign.  

  * Hit **"Save"** to finalize the addition.

* * *

### 2\. **Upload Affiliates in Bulk**

  * Navigate to the Affiliate page and click **"Add"**.
  * Select **"Upload Affiliate"**.  

  * Download the sample CSV file and populate it with your affiliate data.  

  * Upload the completed file and click **"Save"** to add them in bulk.

* * *

### 3\. **Import Affiliates from Contacts**

  * On the Affiliate page, click **"Add"** and select **"Import from Contacts"**.  

  * Choose the contacts you want to convert into affiliates.  

  * Click **"Import"** to add them to your affiliate program.
