# How to Add Sub-Affiliates in the Affiliate Manager

Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 4:30 AM

Sub-affiliates are affiliates who work under a parent affiliate. They promote products or services through their own networks, and the parent affiliate earns a commission from the sales made by their sub-affiliates. This model helps affiliates expand their networks and increase their earnings.

Our platform supports up to 7-tier affiliate campaigns, allowing affiliates to have multiple sub-affiliates under them.

    **Please Note:**
    The campaign you want to add sub-affiliates to must be multi-tier (tier 2 or above).

## **Benefits of Sub-Affiliates**

Sub-affiliates allow for a layered commission structure. For example, if Affiliate A refers Affiliate B, and B makes a sale, both A and B earn commissions. This encourages affiliates to grow their teams and generate more leads.

## **3 Ways to Add Sub-Affiliates**

### **1.  ****Add Sub-Affiliates Manually**

****

Manually adding sub-affiliates allows for greater control over who joins a campaign.

#### **Steps:**

  1. **Navigate to the Affiliate Page** : Go to the Affiliate Manager under the Marketing section.  

  2. **Select an Affiliate** : Click on the affiliate you want to add sub-affiliates under.
  3. **Switch to Sub-Affiliate Tab** : Scroll down to the "Sub-Affiliate" tab.  

  4. **Add Sub-Affiliate** : Click the "Add Sub-Affiliate" button.
  5. **Choose Campaign** : Select the desired campaign from the dropdown.  

  6. **Select Sub-Affiliates to Add** : Choose the affiliates you want to add.  

  7. **Remove Existing Sub-Affiliates** : Remove any unwanted sub-affiliates, if needed.
  8. **Add New Affiliate Profile (Optional)** : Create and add a new sub-affiliate if the desired one doesn't exist.
  9. **Save** : Save the changes.

### **2.  ****Auto-Enroll New Customers as Sub-Affiliates**

****  

This option allows you to automatically enroll new customers as sub-affiliates under the affiliate who referred them after a successful sale.

#### **Steps:**

  1. Go to the **Sub Account Affiliate Manager**.
  2. Open an existing campaign or create a new one.
  3. In the last step, expand **Additional Settings**.
  4. Toggle on **Auto Enroll New Customers as Sub-Affiliates**.  

  5. Save and publish the changes.  

You can also enable or disable this setting globally in the **Global Settings** section. This will apply to all future campaigns.

### **3.  ****Allow Affiliates to Recruit Their Own Sub-Affiliates**

****  

Affiliates can recruit sub-affiliates themselves by sharing a sign-up link. This process makes onboarding easy and gives affiliates more autonomy.

#### **Steps:**

  1. When creating or editing a campaign, go to the last step and click on **Additional Settings**.
  2. Toggle on **Sub-Affiliate Sign-Up Page**.  

  3. Select the form you want to use for sub-affiliate sign-ups.  

  4. Save the changes by clicking **Finish**.  

You can also configure this option globally in the **Global Settings**. Affiliates will see a sign-up link in their affiliate portal, which they can share to recruit sub-affiliates.  

The Affiliate portal will also show a list of all sub-affiliates under each affiliate.

    **Please note:**
    Forms used for sub-affiliate sign-ups must include First Name, Last Name, and Email. Missing fields will result in errors.
    
    The Sub-Affiliate Sign-Up feature only works for multi-tier campaigns (tier 2 or higher).
    
    Changes in global settings will only apply to future campaigns.

By leveraging these methods, you can grow your affiliate network and manage your sub-affiliates effectively, boosting overall sales and commissions.
