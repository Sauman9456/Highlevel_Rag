This user-friendly and secure interface fosters better communication and streamlined operations between your business and its affiliates.

## **What is the Affiliate Portal?**

The Affiliate Portal is a centralized platform where affiliates can manage various aspects of their affiliate marketing efforts. It provides access to performance statistics, commission information, customer data, and more. By logging into the portal, affiliates can track their leads, payments, and campaign success, all while easily accessing their referral links and important affiliate program details.

## **How to Get Started with the Affiliate Portal**

### **Step 1: Adding Affiliates to a Campaign**

Once an affiliate is added to an active campaign, they will receive an invitation email to access the Affiliate Portal. Ensure that the "Invite Email" option is toggled on in the campaign settings.

You can also automate welcome emails or SMS messages with details on how affiliates can get started. Learn more [here].  

### **Step 2: Affiliate Login**

Affiliates can log in using the credentials provided in their invitation email. Once inside, they will be directed to the **Affiliate Dashboard** where they can view their campaign data and affiliate links.

## **What Can Affiliates See in the Portal?**

### **Dashboard Screen**

Affiliates can view all the campaigns they are part of and see key metrics such as leads, customers, clicks, and commissions. They also have quick access to their referral links.

### **Leads/Customers Screen**

This screen provides detailed insights into the leads and customers who signed up or purchased a product through the affiliate’s referral links, allowing them to track the effectiveness of their promotional efforts.

### **Commission Screen**

Affiliates can view the commissions they’ve earned, the total revenue generated, and the status of their payouts.

### **Sub-Affiliate Page**

If the affiliate program includes sub-affiliates, the affiliate can see their sub-affiliates listed here. If sub-affiliate sign-up is enabled, affiliates will also see a form URL they can share to onboard others as sub-affiliates.

By utilizing the Affiliate Portal, affiliates can effectively monitor their progress, strategize future campaigns, and maintain clear communication with your business. This streamlined experience allows for better engagement and performance across your affiliate network.
