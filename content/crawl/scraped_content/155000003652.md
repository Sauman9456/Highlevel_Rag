# How to Set Custom Affiliate Commissions

Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 4:31 AM

## **Affiliate-Level Commission Settings: Customize and Reward Top Performers**

Managing affiliate commissions effectively is key to motivating affiliates and driving the success of your program. The **Affiliate-Level Commission Settings** feature allows you to set **custom commission rates** for individual affiliates within a campaign. This offers a flexible, targeted approach to commission management, letting you reward top performers by overriding default campaign-level settings.

This feature ensures precise control over commission payouts, helping you boost performance and keep your affiliates motivated.

* * *

## **Key Features and Use Cases**

With Affiliate-Level Commission Settings, you can:

  * **Set Custom Commission Rates** : Override the default campaign commission for individual affiliates.
  * **Manage Tiered Commissions** : Adjust commission rates for multi-tiered campaigns.
  * **Reward High Performers** : Offer higher commissions to top-performing affiliates without affecting the rest of the campaign.

* * *

## **Example Use Case:**

Let’s say your default campaign offers a **40% commission** to all affiliates. However, you have an affiliate who consistently drives **high-value sales** , and you want to offer them a higher rate. Using this feature, you can easily set a **50% commission** for that affiliate without changing the overall campaign settings, allowing you to reward their exceptional performance.

## **Steps to Configure Affiliate-Level Commission Settings**

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Sub Account Affiliate Manager**

Log in to your CRM and go to the **Sub Account Affiliate Manager** section.  

### **Step 2: Select the Affiliate**

Find and select the affiliate for whom you want to set a custom commission rate. This will take you to the affiliate's profile page.  

### **Step 3: Choose the Campaign**

Scroll down to the **Active Referral Link** section and click **Customize** next to the campaign where you want to adjust the commission settings.  

### **Step 4: Configure Affiliate-Level Commissions**

  * Switch to the **Commissions** tab.
  * Enter the custom commission rate for that affiliate.
  * If the campaign is **multi-tiered** , configure the commission rates for each tier.
  * You can adjust both **Default Commissions** and **Product-Based Commissions** as needed.
  * Save your changes.  

* * *

### **Important Notes**

  * **Precedence** : Affiliate-level commission settings always take priority over campaign-level settings during commission calculations.
  * **Tier Management** : Tiers cannot be changed within the affiliate profile settings. To adjust tiers, you must modify the campaign settings.
  * **Support** : Currently, this feature is supported only for affiliate campaigns where the source is a funnel or website.

* * *

This feature ensures that you can offer customized incentives, ensuring your top performers remain engaged and motivated. By managing commissions at an affiliate level, you can fine-tune your reward system without affecting your overall campaign structure.
