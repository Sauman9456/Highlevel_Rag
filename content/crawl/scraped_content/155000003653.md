## **How to Set Up and Use Coupon Codes:**

  1. **Access the Affiliate Manager:**
     * Navigate to `Marketing > Affiliate Manager`.
  2. **Select the Affiliate:**
     * In the Affiliate/Promoter module, locate and select the specific affiliate you want to set up coupon codes for.
  3. **Customize the Campaign:**
     * Scroll down to the "Active Referral Links" section. Here, you’ll see a list of campaigns and the affiliate’s URL.
     * For the desired campaign, click on `Customize`.
  4. **Configure the Coupon:**
     * Switch to the `Coupon` tab.
     * Choose the coupon type: `Percentage` or `Fixed`.
     * Enter a user-friendly coupon name.
     * Click on `Generate Code` to create your coupon code.
  5. **Set the Discount:**
     * For a free service, set the discount to `100%`.
     * For a specific discount, set the percentage from `0%` to `100%`. (Note: A `0%` discount is used solely for tracking purposes.)
  6. **Save and Manage:**
     * Click `Save` to finalize the coupon code.
     * You can also edit or manage existing coupon codes within the same pop-up window.

## **Important Notes:**
