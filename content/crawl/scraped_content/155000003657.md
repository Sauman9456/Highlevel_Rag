# How to pay your Affiliates

Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 5:31 AM

GHL allows you to pay your affiliates using any provider or method of your choice, as long as you mark the payouts as completed. However, GHL offers some faster, more efficient options to streamline the process.

* * *

### **Payout Options Available in GHL:**

  1. **Auto Payouts via PayPal (Fastest)** : Automate affiliate payments directly from the GHL dashboard using PayPal Payouts API. No need to log in to PayPal or manually mark payouts as paid.
  2. **Manual Payments** : Use banks or other methods to pay affiliates manually, then mark the payouts as paid in GHL.

* * *

### **How Payouts Work:**

There are two key steps to handling affiliate payouts:

  1. **Generating Payouts** : This is done automatically according to the campaign commissions you've set.
  2. **Paying Affiliates & Marking Payouts as Paid**: You can choose between automated PayPal payouts or manual methods. Here's how each works:

* * *

#### **1\. Auto Payouts Using PayPal (Fastest Option)**

PayPal Payouts API is the quickest and most cost-effective way to pay multiple affiliates at once. After a one-time setup, you can securely pay affiliates without leaving the GHL platform.

#### **2\. Paying Affiliates Through Banks or Other Methods**

For those who prefer manual payments, GHL allows you to process payouts and then mark them as paid. Here's how to do it:

  1. **Go to the Payouts Page** : Head to the payouts section within GHL.
  2. **Approve Payouts** : In the "Pending" tab, approve the payouts you want to process.
  3. **Switch to Approved for Payout Tab** : Navigate to the "Approved for Payout" tab where all approved payouts are listed.
  4. **Select Payouts** : You can select individual payouts or mass-select all of them.
  5. **Click "Pay"** : After selecting the payouts, click "Pay."
  6. **Review the Details** : In the pop-up, you’ll see the total payout value and a list of each payout.
  7. **Make the Payment** : Using your preferred method (e.g., bank transfer), enter the payout details and make the payment.
  8. **Mark as Paid** : Once the payment is complete, return to GHL and click “Mark as Paid” to update the status of the payouts.

By following these steps, you can ensure timely and efficient payments for your affiliates, whether you choose the automated PayPal option or manual methods.
