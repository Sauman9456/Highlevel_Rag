## 1\. **Affiliate Created Workflow Trigger**

### **Trigger Setup** :

  * Go to **Add New Workflow Trigger** > Search for **Affiliate Created** > Choose it.
  * Click on **Save Trigger**.

### **How It Works** :

  * This workflow is triggered whenever a new affiliate is created in the sub-account.

### **Example** :

  * If you run a marketing campaign and several affiliates sign up, the moment each one is added, this trigger ensures they are automatically included in your workflows without manual intervention.

* * *

## 2\. **Add to Affiliate Manager**

### **Automation Setup** :

  * Automatically add a contact to the Affiliates list in the Affiliate Manager with their status set to "active."

### **How It Works** :

  * As soon as the workflow is triggered, a contact is added as an active affiliate in your system.

### **Example** :

  * If a potential partner signs up, they’re immediately added to your list of active affiliates, ensuring no delay in their onboarding process.

* * *

## **3.  ****Update Affiliate**

### **Automation Setup** :

  * Allows you to update the affiliate status as either "active" or "inactive."
  * **Supported Options** :
    * Mark as Active
    * Mark as Inactive

### **Example** :

  * If an affiliate hasn’t met the activity requirements after a set period, this automation can automatically update their status to inactive.

* * *

## 4\. **Add to Affiliate Campaign**

### **Automation Setup** :

  * Automatically add an affiliate to a specific campaign in the Affiliate Manager’s Campaigns tab. Select the campaign from a dropdown menu.

### **Example** :

  * You’ve launched a new product and want all your active affiliates added to this campaign without doing it manually—this automation handles it instantly.

* * *

## **5.  ****Remove from Affiliate Campaign**

### **Automation Setup** :

  * This option removes an affiliate from a campaign. Choose the campaign to remove them from using a dropdown menu.

### **Example** :

  * If an affiliate no longer qualifies for a specific campaign, the system can automatically remove them, reducing your admin workload.

* * *

By automating these tasks, you can focus on scaling your affiliate program without worrying about the small details.
