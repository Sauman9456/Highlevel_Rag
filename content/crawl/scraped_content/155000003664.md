Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 4:56 AM

Affiliate management can be streamlined with automation, and the new **Affiliate Sales Trigger** allows businesses to automate essential tasks when an affiliate sale is made. Here's an overview of what it does and how to use it effectively.

* * *

## **1\. What is the New Affiliate Sales Trigger?**

The **New Affiliate Sales Trigger** is a mechanism that captures all successful affiliate sales—whether they are one-time purchases, recurring transactions, or manual sales. It serves to automate responses, streamline processes, and enhance customer engagement. This trigger is a great tool for customer segmentation, affiliate management, and creating real-time responses to sales.

## **2\. How Does the Affiliate Sales Trigger Work in Workflow?**

To use the Affiliate Sales Trigger within your workflows:

  1. Go to **Automations > Workflows**.
  2. **Create a New Workflow** or select an existing one.
  3. Add the trigger by selecting **Affiliate Sales** from the options.
  4. Customize the trigger name if desired.
  5. Select the relevant affiliate **Campaign**.

Once set, this trigger can be activated each time an affiliate makes a sale.

## **3\. Excellent Use Cases for the Affiliate Sales Trigger**

Here are a few examples of how to put the Affiliate Sales Trigger to use:

### 1\. **Congratulatory Email/SMS to the Affiliate**

  * **Benefit** : Improves affiliate morale and engagement. By acknowledging each sale, affiliates feel valued, leading to higher loyalty and better performance.
  * **Example** : Send an automated message like, "Congrats on your recent sale! Keep up the great work."

### 2\. **Notification Email/SMS to the Customer**

  * **Benefit** : Boosts customer satisfaction by confirming their purchase immediately. This acknowledgment fosters a positive post-purchase experience, increasing the chance of retention.
  * **Example** : Send a message saying, "Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your support."

### 3\. **Add Customer Tag for Segmentation**

  * **Benefit** : Automatically segment customers based on their purchase behavior, making it easier to target them in future marketing campaigns.
  * **Example** : Automatically tag customers who buy from a specific affiliate or campaign as "Affiliate Customers" for future outreach.

### 4\. **Add Notes and Tasks for Customer**

  * **Benefit** : Enhances customer relationship management by tracking post-sale interactions. This provides a detailed customer profile for your team to improve service.
  * **Example** : Automatically create a task for the customer success team to follow up on the new purchase.

By implementing these automations, businesses can create a seamless experience for both affiliates and customers, enhancing satisfaction, engagement, and performance.
