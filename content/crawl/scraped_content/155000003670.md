# Using SaaS Mode with NMI, Authorize.net, and Square

Modified on: Tue, 22 Oct, 2024 at 1:36 AM

SaaS Mode now supports Stripe, NMI, [Authorize.net](//Authorize.net) and Square for processing payments for subscriptions. The system uses the Payments module inside your **'Agency Sub-Account'** to manage customers and subscriptions, which in turn is connected to your payment provider to process payments.

> **'Agency Sub-Account'** is the sub-account that is owned by you (the Agency), which is used for managing your internal operations. None of your customers ideally should have access to this sub-account.  
>   
> It is recommended to create a fresh new sub-account for managing SaaS Mode. You can also have multiple of such sub-accounts.

### **Step 1: Select your Agency Sub-Account(s)**

  * At the agency level, in _**SaaS Configurator > Configure**_ tab, click on _**'Select Sub-Accounts'**_.

  * Select your Agency Sub-Account from the drop-down, and select '**_Add Sub-Account'_**.

### **Step 2: Create SaaS Plans**

  * **Option 1: Via SaaS Configurator**

    1. In your **_SaaS Configurator_** , select the **_'Add Your Plan'_** button.

    2. Select the location (sub-account, from the list of your configured agency sub-accounts) where you need to create the product i.e. the one you'll be using to manage the customers and subscriptions, and process payments.

    3. You'll be redirected to the payments module of the selected sub-account where you can now configure your SaaS plan.  

  * **Option 2: Via the Payments Module**

    1. Switch to your preferred agency sub-account, and go to the **_Payments_** tab.

    2. Select the **_'New Product'_** button.

### **Step 3: Configure your SaaS Plan**

  * Once you are on the Product configuration screen (shown below), make sure to enable the **_'Use as SaaS Product'_** toggle.  
You'll start to see the **_'SaaS'_** section as soon as you enable the toggle.

  * Add all the basic details for your SaaS plan including title, description etc.

  * Scroll to the **_Pricing_** section to setup the monthly & annual prices, and corresponding trial periods.  

  * Scroll to the **_SaaS_** section to configure all the SaaS options including Features, Usage Limits, Complimentary Credits, Rebilling, Reselling etc.

## **Section 3: Onboarding SaaS Clients**

  1. **SaaS clients are automatically onboarded as soon as their plan purchase is successful.**
  2. Regardless of the platform/mode of payment, as soon as the subscription is created for any of the SaaS products, a sub-account is automatically created with the configurations of the respective SaaS plan.
  3. Upon the successful creation of the client's account, they will get an email on their registered email address with the instructions on logging in to the system i.e. Login URL, and the steps to setup their password.
  4. Please refer [this article](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001317) for instructions on customizing the welcome email for your SaaS clients.
