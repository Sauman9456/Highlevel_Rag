# One-Time Pricing Model in the App Marketplace

Modified on: Tue, 1 Oct, 2024 at 8:24 PM

We are excited to announce the release of a new pricing model in the App Marketplace - One-time pricing model.

## **Why is this feature important?**

In Q3, we are launching multiple asset-heavy modules in the marketplace - Snapshots and Widgets. These modules, once installed, cannot be reversed. Hence, a one-time pricing model is necessary for the success of Snapshots and Widgets modules on the App Marketplace. 

## **What is new?**

  * Developers can configure one-time pricing plans while creating apps.
  * For apps of Agency & Sub-account distribution-type, in which agencies can bulk-install across their sub-accounts, developers can configure different pricing for agency and per sub-account.
  * New filters on pricing have been added to enable app discovery based on pricing models
  * Users can install apps paying a one-time fees
