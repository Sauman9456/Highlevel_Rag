## Overview

The Grant/Revoke Private Channel Access workflow action allows for automated management of private channel access, enhancing community interactions and user experience.  

## Trigger Name 

  * Private Channel Access Granted
  * Private Channel Access Revoked

## Action Name

  * Grant Private Channel Access
  * Revoke Private Channel Access

## Action Description

  * The "**Grant Private Channel Access** " action is used when a user wants to grant access to a member for a specific channel (private channel) within a community group. **And simultaneously add to community group as well.** This automation ensures that users receive timely updates and can engage with relevant channel - content and members.
  * The "**Revoke Private Channel Access** " action is used when a user wants to revoke access of a member to a specific channel (example - a private channel) within a community group,**  yet ****keeping them a part of the group**.

## How to Configure

  1. **Navigate to the Workflow Builder:  **Access the Workflow Builder in your GoHighLevel account.
  2. **Create a New Workflow:**
    1. Click on "Create a Workflow."
    2. Select the relevant action type: "Grant Private Channel Access" or "Revoke Private Channel Access"
  3. **Configure Trigger Details** :
     * Specify which group and eventually which private channel you want to grant/revoke access for. You can only see option for private channels and ability to select them, make sure you have relevant private channel
     * **If a member is not a part of the group already, they will be added to the group and eventually the channel you chose.**
     * Add any subsequent actions you wish to automate.  

  4. **Test Your Workflow** : Ensure that the workflow operates as expected by testing it in a controlled environment.
  5. **Save and Activate** : Once confirmed, save your workflow and activate it for use.

## Example

For instance, if a new member joins a book club community, you can set up a workflow that automatically grants them access to the "Book Upgrades" private channel. This ensures they receive immediate updates about upcoming discussions and can engage with other members right away.
