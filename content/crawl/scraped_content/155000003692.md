# **Preparation for Migration**

###  _**Step 1:** Review Current JotForm Setup_

  * **Identify Key Forms and Data:** List all active forms in JotForm, including any associated data, such as submission entries, email notifications, and integrations.  

  * **Document Form Workflows:** Record details of how each form interacts with your current workflows, email notifications, and any third-party integrations.  

  * **Assess Data Volume:** Evaluate the amount of data (e.g., form submissions, contact information) to be migrated.

### _**Step 2:** Define Migration Goals_

  * **Set Clear Objectives:** Determine what you want to achieve by migrating to HighLevel, such as enhanced automation, better integration with CRM tools, or cost savings.  

  * **Prioritize Features:** Decide which forms and data are most critical to migrate first.

### _**Step 3:** Prepare Backup_

  * **Export Data from JotForm:** Export all necessary data from JotForm, including form submissions, templates, and configurations.  

  * **Backup Data:** Ensure all data is securely backed up before beginning the migration process.

* * *

# **Migrate Data**

###  _**Step 1:** Export Data from JotForm_

  * **Export Form Submissions:  **Navigate to each form in JotForm, select the form submissions, and export them as CSV files.  

  * **Export Form Templates:** Save copies of your JotForm templates for reference during the recreation process in HighLevel.

### _**Step 2:** Import Data into HighLevel_

  * **Recreate Forms in HighLevel:**
    * Navigate to Sites > Formsin HighLevel.
      * Use the form builder to recreate your forms, ensuring that all fields match those from JotForm.  

  * **Import Contacts:** If you have contact information stored in JotForm, import this data into HighLevel by navigating to Contacts > Import Contacts and uploading your CSV files.  

  * **Set Up Custom Fields:** In HighLevel, create any necessary custom fields that match the data you were collecting in JotForm.

* * *

# **Migrate Forms and Workflows**

###  _**Step 1:** Review Existing JotForm Workflows_

  * **List Active Workflows:** Identify and document all workflows triggered by form submissions in JotForm, such as email notifications, data routing, and integrations with other tools.  

  * **Evaluate Workflow Complexity:** Assess the complexity of each workflow to determine how best to replicate it in HighLevel.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Recreate Workflows in HighLevel_

  * **Create Automation Triggers:**
    * In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows.  

    * Set up triggers for each form submission that replicates the logic from your JotForm workflows (e.g., sending notifications, updating contact records).  

  * **Rebuild Actions and Conditions:**
    * Recreate actions such as sending confirmation emails, tagging contacts, or updating CRM records.  

    * Set up any necessary conditions or branching logic to mirror your existing workflows.

### _**Step 3:** Test Workflows_

  * **Run Tests:** Before activating workflows, conduct thorough testing to ensure they function as intended.  

  * **Adjust Settings:  **Make necessary adjustments based on test results to ensure smooth operation.

* * *

# **Migrate Integrations and Notifications**

###  _**Step 1:** Recreate Integrations in HighLevel_

  * **Identify Necessary Integrations:** Determine which third-party tools you were integrating with JotForm, such as payment gateways, email marketing tools, or CRMs.  

  * **Set Up Integrations in HighLevel:**
    * Use HighLevel’s built-in integrations or Zapier to connect to external applications.  

    * Go to Settings > Integrations to set up necessary connections.

### _**Step 2:** Recreate Email Notifications_

  * **Set Up Internal Notifications:**
    * In HighLevel, navigate to Automation > Workflows and set up internal notifications for when a form is submitted.  

  * **Configure Autoresponders:** If you were using autoresponders in JotForm, set these up in HighLevel by creating automated email sequences that trigger upon form submission.

* * *

# **Final Checks and Training**

###  _**Step 1:** Perform Final Data Validation_

  * **Cross-Check Data:** Ensure that all data has been successfully migrated and that there are no discrepancies between JotForm and HighLevel records.  

  * **Validate Forms and Workflows:** Confirm that all forms and workflows are operational in HighLevel.

### _**Step 2:  **Train Team Members_

  * **HighLevel Training:** Provide training to your team on how to use HighLevel’s form builder and automation tools, focusing on the differences from JotForm.  

  * **Utilize HighLevel Support:** Encourage team members to leverage HighLevel’s support resources and community forums for ongoing learning.

### _**Step 3:** Monitor and Optimize_

  * **Monitor Performance:** Track the performance of your new setup in HighLevel, making adjustments as necessary.  

  * **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and refine forms, workflows, and integrations to ensure they align with business goals.

* * *

# **Decommissioning JotForm**

###  _**Step 1:** Transition Period_

  * **Run in Parallel:** Consider running JotForm and HighLevel in parallel during the transition phase to ensure no critical operations are missed.  

  * **Gradual Phase-Out:** Gradually reduce reliance on JotForm as HighLevel becomes fully operational.

### **_Step 2:_**_  Cancel JotForm Subscription_

  * **Final Data Backup:** Before canceling your JotForm subscription, ensure all data is securely backed up.  

  * **Official Cancellation:** Follow JotForm’s process to cancel your subscription and terminate services.

### **_Step 3:_**_  Post-Migration Review_

  * **Review Success:** Evaluate the success of the migration process and document any lessons learned.  

  * **Continuous Monitoring:** Keep monitoring the system post-migration for any potential issues.
