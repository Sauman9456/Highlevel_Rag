Example

**Scenario: Create Opportunity and Notify Team After Kitchen Renovation Estimate Acceptance**

**Trigger Setup:**

  * **Trigger** : Estimates
  * **Name** : Create Opportunity for Accepted Renovation
  * **Filters** :
    * **Estimate Status** : Accepted
    * **Estimate Value** : Greater Than 1000

**Workflow Actions:**

  * **Create Opportunity:** Automatically generate an opportunity in the CRM for the kitchen renovation project, including customer details and project value.
  * **Send Internal Notification:  **Notify the project management team about the new opportunity to remind them to assign a project manager.
  * **Send Thank You Email to Customer:** Automatically thank the customer for accepting the estimate and outline the next steps in the renovation process.

**Outcome** : This automation ensures that when a customer accepts a kitchen renovation estimate, an opportunity is created, the team is notified, and the customer receives a thank you email, facilitating a seamless transition to project execution.
