# WhatsApp: Template Level Analytics

Modified on: Tue, 22 Oct, 2024 at 10:19 AM

The new **Template-Level Analytics** feature for the GoHighLevel WhatsApp integration is a powerful tool that gives businesses detailed insights into the performance of their messaging templates. Previously, users had limited visibility into how their templates were performing, making it difficult to optimize communication strategies. With the introduction of this feature, businesses can now monitor key metrics such as the number of messages sent, delivered, and read for each individual template. This allows businesses to evaluate the effectiveness of their messaging efforts more accurately, ensuring that their communication resonates with their audience.

One of the most impactful aspects of this feature is the ability to track **button clicks** within templates. For templates that include interactive elements, such as quick replies or URL buttons, the system now records how many times each button is clicked. This enables businesses to gauge customer engagement in real-time and determine which templates are driving the most interaction. Whether the goal is to promote a product, gather customer feedback, or assist with customer service, businesses will now have the data needed to refine their templates and improve conversion rates.
