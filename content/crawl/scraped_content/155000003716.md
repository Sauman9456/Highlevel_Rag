## Step 3: Obtain the Maps URL

### Method A: From the Address Bar

  1. Once your business listing is open, look at the address bar in your browser.
  2. The URL should look something like this:
    
        Copy
    
    https://www.google.com/maps/place/Your+Business+Name/@XX.XXXXXX,-YY.YYYYYY,17z/data=...

  3. This is your Business Maps URL.

### Method B: Using the "Share" Feature

  1. Click on the "Share" button in your business listing.
  2. In the pop-up window, you'll see a "Copy link" option.
  3. Click "Copy link" to get your Business Maps URL.  

## Step 5: Use the URL in the Prospecting Tool

  1. Open the Prospecting Tool in your GoHighLevel account.
  2. Go to "Search for Virtual Businesses"
  3. Find the "Business Maps URL" section in the form.
  4. Paste the virtual GBP Maps URL you obtained in Step 3 into this section.

## Step 6: Generate More Accurate Results
