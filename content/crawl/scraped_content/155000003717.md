# How to reconnect broken Marketplace Apps? (until 15 October 2024)

Modified on: Tue, 8 Oct, 2024 at 9:27 AM

We had an incident on 7th October 2024 with the way Access Token and Refresh Token were granted to our App Developers.   
More details: <https://status.gohighlevel.com/history>

In response to the above incident, we have provided a temporary solution to all the developers, if your access token or refresh token was corrupted during the above outage 

Please use the Reconnect API (will be discontinued on 15th October 2024) :

For Sub-Account App connections:

    curl --location 'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/reconnect' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "clientKey": "<client_id>",
        "clientSecret": "<client_secret>",
        "locationId": "<locationID where the app was installed>"
    }'

Generic

For Agency connections:

    curl --location 'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/reconnect' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "clientKey": "<client_id>",
        "clientSecret": "<client_secret>",
        "companyId": "<company where the app was installed>"
    }'

Generic

** _NOTE:_** The clientKey, clientSecret pair needs to be the same with which the installation was performed earlier.

Response of the API:

    {
        "authorizationCode": "<auth_code>",
        "expiresAt": "2024-10-08T13:35:43.887Z",
        "traceId": "trace-ID-ref"
    }

Generic

Please use above auth code to generate a new access token & refresh token pair using the existing Token API by following the authorization code flow:
