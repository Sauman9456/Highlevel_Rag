# Community Chat Feature

Modified on: Sun, 27 Oct, 2024 at 9:44 AM

Welcome to **Community Chats** , where you can easily connect with your community through 1-on-1 private messaging. Whether you're a regular user or an admin, this guide will walk you through all the features and privacy settings to ensure you have an amazing and secure experience.  

## **How to Start a Chat**

To start a chat with any member of your community:

  1. **Join a Group** : You need to be a member of a group within the community to initiate chats.  
Go to the **Groups** section, search for a group, and join it.
  2. **Open Community Chat** : Once you’ve joined a group, head to the **Community Chat** tab in your app.
  3. **Select a User** : Choose any user from the group’s member list and click on their name to start a private conversation.

## **What You Can Do in Chats**

With the new Community Chats feature, you can:

  * **Private Messaging** : Have 1-on-1 conversations with any community member.
  * **Share Media & Files**: Easily send photos, videos, documents, and more to enhance your chats.
  * **Use Emojis & GIFs**: Express yourself fully with a wide range of emojis and GIFs! ??
  * **Push Notifications** : Stay up-to-date with new messages by enabling push notifications.
  * **Enable Push Notifications** : Go to your mobile app settings and allow notifications. You'll receive instant alerts, complete with sound, whenever you get a new message.

##   
**Privacy & Security Features**

We understand the importance of keeping your chats safe and ensuring you have control over your experience. Here are some privacy options available to you:

### **Disable Chats for Specific Groups**

If you prefer not to participate in chats for certain groups, you can easily turn off the chat feature:

  1. Go to **Profile** > **Account Settings** > **Community Chat**.
  2. Find the group you’d like to mute and toggle off **Enable Chat**.

You can turn chats back on at any time by following the same steps.

### **Blocking Unwanted Messages**

If someone is sending you unwanted messages or spamming your DMs, you can block them:

  1. Open the chat with the user you want to block.
  2. Click on the **Options** (three dots) in the chat window.
  3. Select **Block User**.  
Once blocked, they won’t be able to send you any further messages.

**FAQs**

### 1\. **Can I start a chat without joining a group?**
