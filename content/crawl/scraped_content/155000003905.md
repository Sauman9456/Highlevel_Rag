# Importing Contacts and Opportunities via CSV

Modified on: Tue, 22 Oct, 2024 at 12:15 PM

The "Import Contacts and Opportunities" feature allows you to efficiently import both contacts and opportunities from a CSV file. You can map fields, create or update records, and monitor the import process seamlessly, ensuring accurate data entry and time-saving for bulk actions.

Do check out the following files before importing both contacts and opportunities: [Import Contacts](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/48000982206?portalId=48000045315) and [Import Opportunities.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000002517?portalId=48000045315)

### **Step 1: Access Import Option**

  * Navigate to the **Opportunities** section and click on the **three dots (options menu)**.
  * Choose the **Import** option to begin the process.  

### **Step 2: Select Objects to Import**

  * In the import screen, select both **Contacts** and **Opportunities** as the objects you want to import and click on "Next".

### **Step 3: Upload CSV File**

  * Upload a CSV file containing details for both **Contacts** and **Opportunities**.
  * Decide for each object whether you want to **Create** , **Update** , or **Create & Update **records during the import.
  * If an **Opportunity ID** is provided in the CSV, the opportunity will be updated. If not, a new opportunity will be created.
  * Click on "Next"

    Contact de-duplication settings will be automatically fetched from the global settings and cannot be updated during the import process

### **Step 4: Map fields**

  * Map fields from the CSV to the correct object fields.
  * **Ensure you are selecting the right object** (Contacts or Opportunities) when mapping each field to avoid errors.
  * This feature also allows the creation of **contacts** with multiple email addresses and phone numbers. These additional details will be added automatically during the import process.
  * If Contacts and Opportunities are on the same line in the CSV, they will be automatically mapped to each other.

### **Step 5: Verify and Import**

  * Review your mappings, then confirm and proceed with the import.
  * You can also choose to create a smartlist, add contacts to a workflow or add a new tag to the imported contacts.

### **Step 6: Monitor Import Status**

  * You can monitor the progress and status of the import via the **Contacts** and **Opportunities Bulk Actions Pages**.
  * Both contacts and opportunities imports will appear in the same place under **Bulk Actions**.
  * Click on the "Show Stats" button to view Stats of the import - you can also download the error log and view further details about the error and how to fix them in the "Error" tab
