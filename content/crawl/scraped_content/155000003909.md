# Recurring Tasks (currently in Labs)

Modified on: Thu, 24 Oct, 2024 at 9:18 AM

Recurring tasks allow you to create tasks that repeat automatically at specified intervals, reducing the need to manually recreate tasks. With this feature, you can configure task recurrence, set end dates, and manage ongoing tasks easily.
