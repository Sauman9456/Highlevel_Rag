# AI Employee Voice Call Capabilities

Modified on: Thu, 24 Oct, 2024 at 10:44 AM

Welcome to the AI Employee’s Voice Features support guide. This document will help you understand how to set up, configure, and make the most of your AI Voice Agent to enhance customer interactions through natural, automated voice conversations.

# Introduction to AI Employee’s Voice Features

The AI Voice Agent is a powerful tool designed to handle inbound calls, interact with customers naturally, and perform actions based on predefined goals. It leverages advanced speech recognition and natural language understanding to provide personalized and efficient customer service, 24/7.

Key Benefits:

  * Natural Conversations: Handles natural speech and understands context.
  * Easy Integration: Seamless integration with your CRM and other business tools.
  * Customizable Responses: Tailor the agent’s personality and responses.
  * Automated Tasks: Schedule meetings, collect customer information, and more.
  * 24/7 Availability: Offers continuous support without downtime.

    Note: Voice AI only works on accounts using LC Phone numbers. It does not work on accounts using Twilio directly.
