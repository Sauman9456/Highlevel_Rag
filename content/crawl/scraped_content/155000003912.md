### **What Are Forms/ Surveys Elements?**

The Forms/ Surveys Element allows you to add pre-built or custom feedback forms (1-10 scoring, like/dislike, 5 stars, etc.). It helps collect and analyze responses via the **Submissions** tab under campaign statistics.

###   
**When to Use It:**

  1. Collect product feedback (1-10 scale).
  2. Gather service reviews (5-star ratings).
  3. Use Like/Dislike forms for simple feedback.
  4. Export data for users with low ratings.

###   
**How to Use:**

  1. Go to **Email Marketing** and create a new campaign.
  2. Add the **Form Element**.
  3. Choose the feedback type (NPS, ratings, etc.).
  4. Customize the form design and settings.
  5. Name the form in the **Title** field.
  6. Set a custom success page.
  7. Send your campaign and monitor responses via **Campaign Statistics** > **Submissions**.
  8. Export the list of respondents if needed.
  9. For pre-built forms, navigate directly to the submission page.
