## Feature 1 - Configuring Searchable Fields for Your Organization

Admins now have the flexibility to update the fields that are searchable for objects such as Contacts, Opportunities, and Custom Objects. This feature allows for streamlined search customization and offers regex search capabilities for specific fields.  
  
For Contacts and Opportunities - you can search for upto 6 fields. 

    A minimum of 3 characters need to be added in the search box for any search to execute.

For Contacts - Contact Name, Phone Number and Email Address are mandatory and cannot be removed from the searchable fields.   
For Opportunities - Opportunity Name cannot be removed from the searachable fields.   

## Feature 2 - Admin Only Access

The ability to configure searchable fields is available **only to admins**. Users do not have the ability to make these changes.

## Feature 3 - Changes Apply Globally

Once the change is applied, the change will reflect across all contact search bars in the platform. 

### For Contacts, that includes:

**1\. Contacts Search bar  **

**2\. Global Search Bar**

**3\. Creating a new message in Conversations**

**4\. Creating a new appointment in Calendars**

**5\. Creating and Updating Tasks in Contacts****  
**

**6\. Contacts and Additional Contacts fields in Opportunities**

## Feature 4 - Regex Search

Users can take advantage of regex for more tailored searches.  
  
However, please note that regex will not work on fields like contact names, phone numbers, monetary values, numeric fields and other similar fields.  
Regex supports:

  * `*abc`: Searches for records ending with "abc."
  * `*abc*`: Searches for records containing "abc."
  * `abc*`: Searches for records starting with "abc."

    Regex search does not work on fields like contact name, phone numbers and monetary values
