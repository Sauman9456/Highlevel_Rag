### **Step 3: Using the Report Builder:**

  * If starting from scratch, you'll be taken to the Report Builder.

  * At the top, you can rename your report to reflect its purpose.

### **Step 4: Customize the Cover Page:**

    * Configure headers for each page.
    * Adjust the background color of the report pages.

### **Step 5: Adding Widgets and Sections:**

  * Once your cover page is set, click the + icon on the left to begin adding widgets.

  * Use the Elements Menu to add titles and organize your report into sections for easy readability.

### **Step 6: Managing Pages:**

  * To add a new page, click on the + icon at the top or bottom of an existing page.

  * To see a list of all pages, click the Page Icon.

  * Drag and drop pages to reorder them and rename them as needed for better organization.

### **Step 7: Download Your Report:**
