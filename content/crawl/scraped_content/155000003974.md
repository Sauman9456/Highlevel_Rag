### **What Are Advanced Filters and Smart Lists?**

  * **Advanced Filters** : This feature lets you apply multiple conditions (filters) to narrow down your workflows. Whether you want to track workflows by specific triggers, actions, or contact tags, Advanced Filters will help you quickly sort through them with precision.
  * **Smart Lists** : After applying filters, you can save the results as a **Smart List**. These custom lists can be saved and accessed anytime, allowing you to keep track of specific workflows based on your criteria.

### **How to Use Advanced Filters**

**Step 1: Accessing Workflows**  
Head over to the **Automations** tab to view the list of all your workflows.

**Step 2: Opening Advanced Filters**  
In the top-right section of the workflows screen, you’ll notice the **Advanced Filters** button. Click on this to start filtering your workflows.

**Step 3: Setting Your Filters**

  * Once the Advanced Filters panel is open, you’ll see a list of possible conditions to filter by. You can filter by criteria such as triggers, specific actions, tags, or any custom data points you’ve added to the workflow.
  * **Select a Filter** : Pick a condition from the dropdown.
  * **Choose the Operator** : You’ll need to select an operator for the filter (e.g., "equals," "contains," "does not contain").
  * **Add Values** : Depending on your filter, you may need to select or input a value. For example, if you are filtering by **Tag** , you’ll choose which tag (e.g., “New Lead”) to filter by.

**Step 4: Adding More Filters**

  * If you need to apply multiple filters, you can choose between two options:
    * **+And** : Adds another filter with the **"And"** condition (all selected filters must be true for a workflow to show).
    * **+Add Filter** : Adds another filter with the **"Or"** condition (if either filter is true, the workflow will appear in the results).

**Step 5: Apply the Filters**  
Once you’ve added the filters, hit the **Apply** button to view the workflows that match your criteria.

### **How to Use Smart Lists**

**Step 1: Saving Your Filtered View**  
After applying filters, you’ll notice that the **Save** button is highlighted, signalling that you’ve made changes to the view. To keep this customized view, click on the **Save** button.

**Step 2: Creating a Smart List**

  * When you hit Save, you’ll have two options:
    * **Save as new Smart List** : This saves the filtered workflows as a new list.
    * **Discard Changes** : This removes the filters and resets your view.

**Step 3: Accessing Your Smart Lists**  
Once saved, the new Smart List will appear as a tab at the top of your workflows, right next to the **"Needs Review"** tab. You can now easily switch between your Smart Lists and your default workflow views.

**Step 4: Creating a Smart List from Scratch**  
You can also create a Smart List without applying filters by clicking the **\+ Smart List** button. From there, add the filters you want, and click **Save** to create a new custom list based on those criteria.

**Step 5: Managing Smart Lists**  
To delete or edit a Smart List:

  * Click on the **Customize List** button.
  * From here, you can modify filters or delete the Smart List entirely if it’s no longer needed.

###   

### **Use Cases for Advanced Filters and Smart Lists**

Here’s how you can get the most out of these new features:

  * **Track Specific Workflows using actions or triggers** : Use filters to isolate workflows with specific triggers or actions (e.g., workflows triggered by form submissions) and save them as Smart Lists for quick access.
  * **Track Specific Workflows using tags** : Use filters to isolate workflows with specific tags and save them as Smart Lists for quick access.

### **FAQs**

**Q. What is the difference between a filter and a Smart List?**  
A. Filters allow you to narrow down your workflows based on selected criteria. A Smart List is a saved view of those filtered results, allowing you to easily revisit those filtered workflows later.

**Q. How many filters can I apply at once?**  
A. You can apply as many filters as needed. The Advanced Filters feature allows for both "And" and "Or" conditions to give you flexibility when narrowing down workflows.

**Q. How do I edit or remove a Smart List?**  
A. To edit a Smart List, click on the **Customize List** button and adjust the filters. To remove it, click on **Delete** from the same menu.

**Q. What Smart Lists will be visible to users and admins?**  
A. The view and edit permissions for Smart List will work as mentioned below

  * If a user is creating a smart list - that user and admin can see the smart list.
  * If an admin is creating a smart list - all admins can see, but the same will not be visible to the users.
  * If one user is creating a smart list other user will not be able to see it.
  * There is an existing user which gets upgraded to admin, then they will be able to see all the smart list that are created.
  * There is an existing admin gets downgraded to user, then they will be able to see only smart list created by them.

**Q. Can I use Advanced Filters on all types of workflows?**  
A. Absolutely! Advanced Filters can be used on any workflows within your automations, regardless of complexity or structure.
