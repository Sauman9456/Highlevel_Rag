# Advanced Filters for Custom Objects

Modified on: Tue, 22 Oct, 2024 at 12:13 PM

The following document provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the **Advanced Filters** feature for custom objects. This feature allows users to apply detailed filters across various fields, including custom attributes, to refine data searches. The guide outlines step-by-step instructions on how to access and use these advanced filters, making it easier for users to locate specific data efficiently.

    Custom Objects feature is available only on the $497 plan

### **Step 1: Access the Advanced Filters Panel**

  * Find the option to apply "Advanced Filters" on the top right of the Custom Objects page

### **Step 2: Populate the Filters**

  * In the **Advanced Filters** panel, search or select fields that you want to filter by. You can apply filter conditions using **AND/OR** logic to refine your search further.

    * Use the search bar to quickly locate a field.
    * Expand categories like **Other Details** , **Car Info** , and **Price** to choose fields.
    * You can filter based on both default and custom object field

### **Step 3:****Apply the Filters**

  * Group multiple filters using the "And" / "OR" logics to apply more complex filter logics
  * You can manage the filter order in the panel for better clarity.
  * To remove filters, simply deselect them or click the reset button.

    Advanced filters are only applied in the local setup and cannot be saved immediately. Upcoming feature to create Smartlists will solve for the saving of Filters
