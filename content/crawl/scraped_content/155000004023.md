## Feature 1: Creating a New Custom Object Record

To create a new custom object record, follow these steps:

  1. **Navigate to the relevant custom object** :

     * In the left-hand navigation panel, select the custom object type (e.g., **Pets** , **Cars** , etc.).
  2. **Click "Add" to Create a New Record** :

     * On the top right corner of the screen, click on the **Add** button (e.g., “Add Pet”).
  3. **Fill in the Required Fields** :

     * In the form that appears, enter the value for the primary field for that object.
  4. **Save the Record** :

     * Once the required information is added, click **Save**.
     * Optionally, you can choose **Save and Add Another** to create additional records without leaving the form.

    You can only add values for the primary fields while creating a custom object record

## Feature 2: Updating an Existing Custom Object Record

To update a record, follow these steps:

  1. **Open the Custom Object Record** :

     * Navigate to the list of custom objects and locate the record you wish to update.
     * Click on the record name to open its details.
  2. **Edit the Required Fields** :

     * Click the **Edit** button to make changes to the object.
     * Update fields such as text, numeric values, dropdowns, etc., based on the changes you need to apply.
  3. **Save Changes** :

     * After making the necessary updates, click the **Save** button to apply changes.
     * Alternatively, click **Cancel** if you do not wish to save the changes.

## Feature 3: Managing Related Objects

Learn more about associations [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/a/solutions/articles/155000003063?portalId=48000070066)

For some custom objects, you may want to associate other records like contacts, products, or houses with them. Here’s how you can manage those associations:

  1. **Navigate to the "Related Objects" Section** :

     * Open the object record and locate the **Related Objects** section.
     * Click **Add** next to the object you want to associate (e.g., Contacts, Products).
  2. **Associate New Records** :

     * Search for the related record (e.g., a contact) you want to associate and click **Associate** to link it to the custom object.

## Feature 4: Deleting a Custom Object Record

If you need to delete a custom object record, follow these steps:

  1. **Open the Record** :

     * Navigate to the record you wish to delete and open it.
  2. **Click on the Kebab (Three Dots) Menu** :

     * In the record details view, click the kebab menu (three dots) on the top right.
  3. **Select "Delete"** :

     * From the dropdown, click **Delete Record** to permanently remove the record.
     * In the next confirmation modal, confirm the deletion.

    Deleting a custom object is an irreversible change. Once deleted, a custom object record cannot be restored.
