# Blogs Importer - Get All your Blog Posts

Modified on: Mon, 21 Oct, 2024 at 11:09 AM

Get your Blog Post from any place inside Sites > Blogs, It is seamless migration of blog post importer if the sitemap is publicly exposed. Use the Blog importer to import all the blog post and its content, category and author.

 Key Features:

1\. Easy 3-Step Process - Add the blog URL and recent blog post URL to scan and preview the content.

Note: If the iframe is blocked, the blog post preview will not be displayed but functionality will work.

2\. Mapping Breakdown - Map the blog title, category/tag, featured images, published date, content, and author from the preview.

3\. Review and publish -  your content when you're ready! :smile:

**Pre-checks:**

Before you begin, ensure the blog has a sitemap for posts.

For example, for a blog at blog.abc.com, check blog.abc.com/sitemap.xml for a sitemap.

**How Does It Work?**

**Step 1: Setup Your Import**

\- Go to Sites > Blog

\- Click on the blog name

\- Navigate to New Post > Import Blog Post

\- Enter the blog URL and the last published blog post URL

\- Choose where you're importing from

Tip: After setup, you can revisit to see the "Scan in Progress" status in the "Imported Content" section.

**Step 2: Map Content** - Select the blog title, published date, author name, content, and category/tag

Note: If mapping is incorrect, you can manually select the CSS selector (reference: CSS Selectors).  

**Step 3: Import Content**

Once the scraping is complete (usually 10-20 minutes for 1,000 posts), you can import each post individually or in bulk. Note: All posts will initially be imported as drafts.

Recommendation:

Preview your blog post before publishing it live.
