  * Why We Built It

## What’s New?

  * **Opportunity Custom Values in Templates:** You can now leverage Opportunity Custom Values directly within document templates, available exclusively through workflows.
  * **Auto-Populated Data:** Document templates will auto-populate with updated opportunity data during workflow execution.

## How to Use

  1. **Save a Template with Opportunity Custom Value Fields:**

  2. **Set Up a Workflow:**

     * Configure a workflow where opportunity values are updated.
  3. **Use the Send Document Trigger:**

     * Within the workflow, use the **Send Document** trigger. This will automatically pull in the updated opportunity custom values into the selected document template.

## Why We Built It

  * **Consistent Communication:** To enable users to send documents with data from different opportunities to the same contact.
  * **Automation:** To automate document generation using up-to-date opportunity data and reduce manual entry.
  * **Seamless Integration:** To enable seamless integration between workflows and document management, improving the user experience for contract and document handling.
