# Appointment Options in If-else action

Modified on: Wed, 23 Oct, 2024 at 12:32 AM

What's New ?

  * We've introduced appointment variables in If-else action that allows users to select and customise workflows behaviour on the basis of appointment events.
  * Now, customers can create new branches based on whether an appointment was rescheduled or not for that execution.
  * Customers can also use Start date and end date of an appointment in the if/else action
  * The users will have 3 new options in if-else conditions to select from:

  1. Appointment Rescheduled - Denotes whether the appointment was rescheduled for that specific executions
  2. Start Date - Refers to the start date of the appointment event
  3. End Date - Refers to the end date of the appointment event

How it works?

  * Select Appointment option in the if/else branch dropdown
  * Now you can select from the following options - Appointment Rescheduled, Start Date and End Date

Note : Either or both of triggers - Appointment Status or Customer booked appointment needs to selected for this option to be available.

Real Life Use Cases:

  * Streamline workflow branches according to condition - whether the appointment was rescheduled or not.
  * Similarly workflow actions can be reordered making use of Start Date and End Date of an appointment.
