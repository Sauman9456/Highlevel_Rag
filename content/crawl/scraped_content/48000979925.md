| Assigned User Email| N/A| 2nd priority  
  
| Location Email| 2nd priority| 3rd priority  
  
| Agency Email| 3rd priority| 4th priority  
Review Request Emails| We will always use the **Logged in user email** as the sender email  
Appointment request emails  
(calendar settings->3\. Confirmation)| We will use [do-not-reply@replies.domain.com](mailto:do-not-reply@replies.domain.com) depending on the Mailgun subdomain you set up for the location, or the SMTP integrated email  

If you are using Mailgun/LC Email, we will use the Business email here if the lead is not assigned:

## **FAQs**

### **1\. Why is the From email for outlook always look long and strange?**

This is an issue with how Outlook displays the sender's information. If you send this email to gmail.com, it will show the sender's information correctly in Gsuite.
