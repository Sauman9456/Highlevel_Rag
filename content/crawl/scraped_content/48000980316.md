# Click-To-Call, Click-To-Text, and Click-To-Email Links & Buttons

Modified on: Sun, 29 Dec, 2019 at 11:06 AM

How to make links and buttons that people can click or tap to call or tap to email

Click-to-call buttons/links are a great way to reduce friction for the end use and increase conversion, especially on mobile devices, by allowing them to simply click or tap a button/link to launch a phone call. 

### Click-To-Call Buttons

Creating click-to-call buttons in the funnel builder is easy thanks to the actions dropdown:

### Click-To-Text Buttons

You can also use the Button Actions dropdown to select the "Click To SMS", which will open up your phone or computer's default messaging service. 

### Click-To-Call Text Links

To create a text link that people can click/tap to initiate a phone call:

  1. Add a Paragraph element
  2. Type the phone number
  3. Highlight the whole number and click the "Add A Link" icon, then type tel: followed by the + symbol then the country code (01 for US numbers) then the number.
  4. Hit Enter to save

So if the phone number you want to make a link for is 555-555-5555, you would enter tel:+015555555555 then hit enter: 

### Click-To-Email Links

To make a text link that people can click/tap to open up an email pre-addressed to a email address of your choosing: 

  1. Add a Paragraph element
  2. Type the text you want to make a link
  3. Highlight the text and click the "Add A Link" icon, then type mailto: followed by the email address.
  4. Hit Enter to save

So if the email we wanted people to be able to send to via this link were [chase@gohighlevel.com,](mailto:chase@gohighlevel.com,) we would enter [mailto:chase@gohighlevel.com](mailto:chase@gohighlevel.com) then hit enter:
