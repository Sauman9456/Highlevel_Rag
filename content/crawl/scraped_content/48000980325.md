# Become A HighLevel Affiliate

Modified on: Thu, 17 Mar, 2022 at 12:32 PM

## Earn Recurring Income By Becoming A HighLevel Affiliate!

### Let's Grow Together!

Here's the scoop... 

The HighLevel affiliate program pays out a 40% monthly recurring commission for every paying agency customer you send us (we call this a "Tier 1" affiliate). Additionally, HighLevel pays out an additional 5% monthly recurring commission for every paying agency signed up by an agency that you signed up (we call this a "Tier 2" affiliate).

So if you send us an agency customer who goes on the Agency Unlimited plan at $297/month, we'll send you $118.80 every month they remain a customer! 

> The HighLevel Affiliate Program is an incredible way for marketing agencies to open up a new revenue stream that's basically 100% margin.
