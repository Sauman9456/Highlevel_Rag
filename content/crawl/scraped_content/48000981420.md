# How to Purchase a Phone Number in a Sub-Account

Modified on: Mon, 29 Jul, 2024 at 12:38 PM

Before you continue with this guide, please make sure you have set up your agency telephony provider. If you still need to, please follow [**this guide first**](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204027), as you can only purchase a phone number once a provider has been selected.

# **Step 3. Once you are in the sub-account, click on Settings**

# **Step 4: Click on Phone Numbers**

# **Step 5: Click on Add Number**

# **Step 6: Select the Country you want to purchase the number for.**

Here's a list of countries supported by LC Phone System/ Twilio:

[Twilio international phone number availability and capabilities](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223183068-Twilio-international-phone-number-availability-and-their-capabilities)

If the country you want is on the list but not visible within the system, you can **[buy the number through the Twilio console for the location](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001219820-how-to-buy-a-twilio-number-for-the-highlevel-location-inside-twilio-console-). (** **_ONLY_** applicable to Agencies who have **integrated Twilio as the default telephone provider**)

A regulatory bundle/Address is required if your agency resides outside the _**USA or Canada**_**.  **

**Please Note:**

     Regulatory Bundles/Address are an industry-standard practice, not a HighLevel-specific requirement.   
      
    If your sub-account is outside of the USA and Canada, we highly recommend that you complete the regulatory bundle/address registration for the best telephone experience.  
      
    If you are using **_Twilio_ **as your agency phone provider, please check out how to [Purchase a Twilio Number - "Please Select Bundle/Address to Purchase Number."](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000981437)
