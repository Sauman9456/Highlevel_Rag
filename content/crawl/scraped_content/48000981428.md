Modified on: Fri, 17 Feb, 2023 at 1:10 PM

Once you are in the subaccount, click on Settings (bottom left)

Click on Phone Numbers

Click on the trash icon to remove the number

Once you confirm by typing **Delete** below, Click on **Confirm Delete**

If you want to keep/reset the twilio number webhooks, click on NO here so the number will still exist in your Twilio sub-account.

Otherwise, confirm by typing **Release** below and click on **Confirm Release**.

Once you click on NO, 

Click on **Add  **to add back the Twilio number to the account, this helps to reset the Twilio number's webhook
