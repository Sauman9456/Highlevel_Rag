    * 1\. If I log in as the user with an assigned Twilio number, why are calls going from the default Twilio number?

## Blind Transfer

Search Contact, click on the Contact to **Transfer & End** the current call

## Warm Transfer

Search Contact, click on the Contact to **Call & Hold **the current call, once they pickup, we can merge them.

## 1\. If I log in as the user with an assigned Twilio number, why are calls going from the default Twilio number?

Calls will be dialed out from the user-assigned Twilio number only if the user has only assigned data enabled and the user role is User. 

If the user doesn't have only assigned data enabled and the user role is an Admin, we will use the default Twilio number to call. To switch the number to use for outbound calls, once we click on the dialer, we can select the Twilio number from the **Call from** dropdown here:
