# **How and where to record voicemail drop messages**

Record the voicemail message on this website: <https://recordmp3online.com/>

Alternatively, If the voicemail file quality is high, these instructions should help you make it compatible to more carriers:

1\. go to **<https://online-audio-converter.com/>** and upload the voicemail file  

2\. Convert to **ECONOMY 64kbps MP3  **

3\. Upload it back to the voicemail step

# **Other recording options**

If it's still not working, you can try to convert the file further here:

You'll need to get [audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)

You'll need to get [LAME](https://lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl)

1\. Drag and drop your audio file into audacity

2\. On the bottom left, lower the project rate down to 8000

3\. Tracks -> Resample... -> 8000 -> OK

4\. File -> Export Audio... -> Name the File in the Save As-> Format: Other uncompressed files -> Options -> Header: WAV -> Encoding: U-Law -> OK -> Save -> OK
