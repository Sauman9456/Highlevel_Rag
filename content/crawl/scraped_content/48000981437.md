# Purchase Twilio Number - "Please Select Bundle/Address to Purchase Number"

Modified on: Mon, 21 Mar, 2022 at 12:08 PM

**If you are buying a phone number for countries like Australia, you might encounter this error Please select 'address' to purchase number.**

****

**That's because we will need to verify  ****the address and bundle in the Twilio  **_**SUB-account**_**:**

**1\. Go to the _Account dropdown_ on the top-right menu, click on **Subaccounts

[https://console.twilio.com/](https://console.twilio.com/?)

**  
**

****

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

**2\. If there are too many subaccounts inside Twilio, you can go back to HighLevel and copy the Account SIN for that location to search in Twilio:**

<https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/twilio>

**  
**

**  
**

Search based on the Twilio Subaccount SID in HighLevel agency settings - > Twilio

Paste the Account SID here and click on it:

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

**3\. Click into the subaccount so you will see there's an orange text on the top left:**

****  

Go to Explore Products - > Scroll down to click on **Phone numbers**

For Dual Functionality (Voice and SMS enabled) Phone Numbers, please choose Mobile for the type of Phone numbers here:

Once the bundle is added, add an address as well:

Once Twilio approved the bundles, the bundles and addresses will show up in the dropdown once you are trying to buy numbers in the location.
