The next screen that you're taken to will ask you to add DNS records to your domain. Leave this screen open for the next step.

##   

## To add the 1st TXT record

  1. Log in to [cPanel](https://portal.hostgator.com/hosting/cPanel/sso-redirect?redirect=/frontend/paper_lantern/).
  2. Look for the **Domains** section, then click **Zone Editor**.

  3. On the next page, Locate your domain in the **Zone Editor** section, then click its **Manage** button.
  4. Click **Manage** to view the domain's complete set of DNS records.
  5. Click the **+Add Record**  button and select **Add "TXT" Record**

A. Name: Different for everyone, **DO NOT INCLUDE THE ROOT DOMAIN**

    * [mg.companyname.com](//mg.companyname.com) The host name will be **mg**
    * [replies.companyname.com](//replies.companyname.com) The host name will be **replies**
  * If you are setting up a **main** domain like companyname.com, the host name will be **@**

Examples: **copy the highlighted part ONLY**

Example 1 using subdomain:  
Copy mx._domainkey.helpdesk as the host name|

Copy mailo._domainkey as the host name|

**

## To add the 1st MX records

If you have a Gsuite account to capture incoming emails for the main domain. Make sure you are using a subdomain for Mailgun. Check out [Can I Use the Same Domain Name for Mailgun and for Google Apps (Or Another Email Server)?](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203357040-Can-I-Use-the-Same-Domain-Name-for-Mailgun-and-for-Google-Apps-Or-Another-Email-Server-)

[mg.companyname.com](//mg.companyname.com) The host name will be **mg**

[replies.companyname.com](//replies.companyname.com) The host name will be **replies**

If you are setting up a **main** domain like companyname.com, the host name will be **@**

    paste the following data **mxa.mailgun.org**** **

E. Click on **Save Record**

  * mg.companyname.com The host name will be **email****.****mg**
  * replies.companyname.com The host name will be **email****.****replies**
