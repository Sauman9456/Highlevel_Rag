# Facebook Troubleshooting - Integration Issues

Modified on: Thu, 9 Jan, 2020 at 1:40 PM

Troubleshooting tips if you are having trouble integrating your client's Facebook business page in Settings -> Integrations

**Facebook Integration Issues you may be having:**

1\. Wheel keeps spinning after you went through the Facebook Integration Path in Settings -> Integrations

2\. When clicking Connect on Facebook in Settings -> Integrations, you are redirected to a broken page

3\. Facebook Form Fields Mapping section is not displaying the forms that reside under the Facebook Business Page you are trying to integrate

**Troubleshooting Steps**

1\. Clear cache/cookies, log out of HighLevel, close the browser. Reopen the browser and try again

2\. Go to your Agency View -> Settings -> Agency Settings -> See what is in the Whitelabel Domain field

Did you properly WhiteLabel the domain to whatever you put in that field? Here is the video on how to do that: [White Label the Web App](https://help.gohighlevel.com/help/white-label-the-web-app)

If you did, look at the URL in the address bar, you are probably logged in via app.gohighlevel.com, **which you should not be**

Go to app.thenameofyourdomain.com (or whatever you WhiteLabeled to), log in that way and try to integrate Facebook again

If the Facebook integration is still giving you issues, please reach out to us
