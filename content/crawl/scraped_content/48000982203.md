# Trigger/workflow - Email/SMS Notifications to Client/Yourself (New Lead)

Modified on: Wed, 6 Jul, 2022 at 4:09 PM

Note: Now that Workflows are live in all accounts, you can do everything that Triggers and Campaigns do (and more!), all in one builder! [Click to learn more about Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001179678-workflow-builder-overview).

Send an email and/or SMS notification to your client(s) and/or yourself when a lead is added to a campaign:

# How to send internal notifications for workflows:

## Set up a new workflow:

Click on Start from scratch

Click on Create workflow

Click on Add New Workflow Trigger

Once you configured the workflow trigger:

Click on Add your first Action

Click on Send Internal Notification

Choose the type of notification:  

Email notification

Internal notification:

SMS notification

# Rate limiting on Workflow Notifications

We have added Rate Limiting for Internal Notification action of workflows.

The current rate limits are

  * 500 notifications / 5mins for each user (Per workflow)
    * In the case of email, its 500 notifications per 5 mins, per user email
    * In the case of SMS, its 500 notifications per 5 mins, per user's phone
    * In the case of in-app notifications, its 500/5mins per user Id

We will skip any notifications that are sent after breaching this limit.

Why was this done, and how will this help?

  * Because no limit was enforced, there were several updates made to a specific conversation of a user.
    * Let's say you put 300k contacts into a workflow
    * And in the internal notification you are sending a mail to a particular user (in most cases we have seen customers set up to send a notification to themselves)
    * Now this particular user mail, will get 300k emails.
    * Because of this, the conversation of this user will be updated 300k times, within a few seconds/minutes.
    * This introduced an overall delay in processing workflow actions.

The rate-limiting should have good gatekeeping for these events, and also prevent customers to send bulk emails to a particular user
