# White Label the Android App

Modified on: Mon, 6 Sep, 2021 at 9:59 PM

### **Please ensure you have purchased the White Label Mobile App Service ($497/month) from the Marketplace before you start the process in this article.**

[](https://app.gohighlevel.com/marketplace/detail/ItpFPfVrlnRfHzIz3gap)<https://app.gohighlevel.com/marketplace>

It's necessary to register for a Google Developer account in order to upload Android apps. Your Developer account is where you'll submit, as well as manage your apps. It costs a one-time fee of $25.

We recommend setting up a second Google account for this purpose, so you can separate it from your other Google services (Gmail, Google Drive, Google+, etc.) if you already have a personal account.

How-To:

1\. Register for an Android Develop account [here](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console/). You'll need to log into the Google account you'd like to use.

2\. You'll be taken through a 4-step registration process. Check the agreement box and click Continue to payment.

3\. Next, a pop-up window will prompt you to input your billing information. After you've filled it out, click Pay.

4\. Finally, complete your account info. You should receive a confirmation email after you've finished!
