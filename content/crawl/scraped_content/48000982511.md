# Snapshots - Overview

Modified on: Mon, 4 Mar, 2024 at 10:24 AM

A snapshot is a template of a particular sub-account that is used to transfer items such as Funnels, Calendars, Workflows, Websites, Custom Values, Trigger Links, Message templates, etc., to another account. The idea behind this feature is that it allows the agency owner to build and customize many different assets and settings so they can be applied to new accounts, thereby minimizing the amount of work that needs to be done when it is created. 

**List of client account items copied using Snapshots:**

  1. Custom Fields
  2. Custom Values ***0**
  3. Triggers ***1**
  4. Trigger Links
  5. Surveys
  6. Forms
  7. SMS Templates
  8. Email Templates ***2**
  9. SMS ***3**
  10. Email ***4**
  11. Custom Communications ***5**
  12. Campaigns ***6*7**
  13. Pipelines
  14. Calendars ***8**
  15. Tags
  16. Folders
  17. Funnels ***10**
  18. Membership products and offers
  19. Workflows ***9**
  20. Teams ***11**
  21. Marketplace actions and triggers ***12**
  22. Internally created actions and triggers

***Notes**
