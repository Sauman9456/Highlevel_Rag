# Refresh/Update Snapshots

Modified on: Wed, 5 Aug, 2020 at 8:33 PM

Snapshots do not update automatically when you make changes to the client account the Snapshot was based off of. You need to manually refresh the Snapshot.

Follow the steps below to refresh a Snapshot:

  1. Click Settings (Agency View)
  2. Click Account Snapshot
  3. Click the Refresh snapshot button on the right side of the Snapshot you wish to update
  4. Click Ok when prompted

Keep watching the next video, what will happen when you click the **Push update button** ->
