## **F****or those with Account Admin access** \- Go to the Account >> Settings >> My Staff

## User Permissions

User permissions are a great way to limit your client's access to certain features/areas within HighLevel.

"Only Assigned Data" is a great way to limit salespeople from seeing each other's leads, opportunities, conversations

Limiting user access to only assigned data in the subaccount will constrain their activity and capabilities. 

This implies that users will exclusively view or have access to the information they own.

## Contacts 

Users will see only their assigned contacts and the corresponding conversations.

## Campaigns (read-only) 

Users can view the campaign and its content but won't have the ability to edit it.

## Calendar

Users will only observe their assigned calendar and appointed meetings.

## Pipeline/Opportunities 

Users will exclusively access their assigned opportunities in the pipeline.

**Note** : there is no option to assign tags, funnels, workflows, etc. 

Therefore, toggling the "only assigned data" feature will restrict user access to these functionalities.
