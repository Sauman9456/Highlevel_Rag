### **How does email validation work?**

Email validation validates new contacts when entering the system for the first time (form, survey, calendars, chat widget) or when sending a new email _**after  **enabling email validation**.**_

Head into the contact record >scroll down the right side > click the envelope icon.

  * Green = Valid
  * Red = Invalid, too old, previously bounced, unsubscribed, etc. The error would specify why the Email is invalid.
