# How To Sell HighLevel Websites

Modified on: Tue, 7 Apr, 2020 at 4:27 PM

Websites can be one of the best products to offer your clients because they dramatically increase client retention. 

In this presentation we cover why websites are a great product for you to sell, three opportunities to look for when selling websites, and some common pitfalls to avoid along the way.

**Website Audit**

As mentioned in the presentation, a website audit that you can run potential website clients through is a great sales tool. Here are some ideas for audit questions: 

  * Does the page load quickly? (Use <https://tools.pingdom.com/> or <https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/>)
  * Does the site look good on a phone?
  * Is there a clear value statement heading above the fold?
  * Is there a call to action above the fold?
  * Does the site contain all critical business info?
  * Are all fonts easy to read?
  * Does site have unique imagery?
  * Is there 20px of spacing between elements?
  * Are elements evenly spaced?
  * Does the site have trust symbols/testimonials?
