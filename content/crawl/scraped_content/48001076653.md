# Phone Call Redirect Loop

Modified on: Fri, 7 Apr, 2023 at 2:35 PM

If you're hearing a loop on phone calls or you're seeing lots of calls stack up, one after the other, in Conversations, odds are one of your users has been assigned a Twilio number but also has that number set in the Phone field in their user settings.

Another possible reason is that the business phone number or the forwarding number set might look like a different number from the Twilio number, but it is configured to route back to the Twilio number. So this will cause a call loop because we will try to forward the calls to the business phone number.
