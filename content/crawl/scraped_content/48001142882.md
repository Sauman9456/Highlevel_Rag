# Positive Intent Trigger

Modified on: Mon, 12 Jul, 2021 at 12:56 PM

Note: Now that Workflows are live in all accounts, you can do everything that Triggers and Campaigns do (and more!), all in one builder! [Click to learn more about Workflows](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001179678-workflow-builder-overview).

The Positive Intent Trigger is a great way to automate followup based on positive replies to specific campaigns.
