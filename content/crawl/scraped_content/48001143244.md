# How to Configure Brand System-Generated Links (API Domain)

Modified on: Thu, 10 Oct, 2024 at 1:22 PM

With our API domains (Branded Domains), you can brand your system-generated links to represent a chosen domain. We highly recommend adding your API domain to increase deliverability and brand recognition when sending out links.

Setting a custom API domain updates the domain shown in the links that are generated for:

  * Forms
  * Surveys
  * Calendar Links
  * Trigger Links
  * Shortlinks
  * Review Links

### **You can brand system-generated links at two levels:**

**1\. Agency Level (API Domain)**

**2\. Sub-Account Level (Branded Domain)**

* * *

# **Agency Level (API Domain)**

Configuring your API Domain at the agency level creates a default branded domain that will be used by all sub-accounts. This will apply to links generated for things like the Calendar Scheduler and Invoices, for example.

To configure a branded domain at the Agency Level: 

  * Within the Agency View, go to "Settings" > "Company" and scroll to the API Domain field shown below
  * Enter the sub-domain you want the system to use when creating links (something like links.yoursite.com)

  * Next, go to to your domain registrar (e.g. GoDaddy, CloudFlare, Namecheap, etc) and create a CNAME record in your DNS settings for (using the example above) 'links' that points to **brand.ludicrous.cloud**

**  
**

  * ** _IMPORTANT_ : Scroll to the bottom of Agency Settings page > Company page and click the "Update Company" button to save your changes.**

* * *

# **Sub-Account Level (Branded Domain)**

Configuring your API Domain (Branded Domain) at the sub-account level creates a default branded domain that will be used for only that sub-account. This supersedes the agency level branded domain.

To configure a branded domain at the Sub-Account Level: 

  * Within the Sub-Account view, go to "Settings" > "Business Profile" and scroll to the Branded Domain field
  * Enter the sub-domain you want the system to use when creating links (something like links.yourclient.com)

  * Click the "Add Domain" button and the [domain connect wizard](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000000734-how-to-use-the-domain-connect-feature-) will launch. Follow the prompts to have the wizard automatically create the CNAME in your domain registrar

If you need to create the CNAME manually:

  * Go to your domain registrar and create a CNAME record in your DNS settings for (using the example above) 'links' that points to **brand.ludicrous.cloud**

  * ** _IMPORTANT_****:  ****Scroll****  to the bottom of Sub-Account Settings > Business Profile page and click the "Update Information" button to save your changes.**

## **Troubleshooting:**

    **NOTE** : If you previously set up your API/Branded domain and you want to update it to run on brand.ludicrous.cloud, you'll need to first clear the API/Branded Domain field, click Update Company to save, then re-enter your sub-domain into the API/Branded Domain field and save again. 

    The API Domain is **not** for development purposes and is only designed to **White Label (or mask) the links generated** for the features mentioned in the above article.   
      
    Your API Domain will not function in replace of any API Documentation provided on [https://developers.gohighlevel.com](https://developers.gohighlevel.com/). Please use the endpoints exactly as provided if you are developing third-party integrations. We currently do not offer White Label API endpoints for API 2.0 or API 1.0.
