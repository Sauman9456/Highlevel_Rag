# Automatically Merge Facebook Messenger Contacts With Lead Ad Contacts

Modified on: Thu, 18 Jun, 2020 at 10:26 AM

By default, incoming Facebook Messages will create a new contact in HighLevel based on the name, which will be a duplicate contact if that person has already completed a Lead Ad Form. By toggling ON the "Merge Facebook Contacts By Name" setting in Settings - Company Settings, however, you can automatically merge incoming FB Messenger contacts with the existing contact.
