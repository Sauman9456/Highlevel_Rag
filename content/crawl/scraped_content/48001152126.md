# Which Twilio phone number will the leads be getting the SMS from?

Modified on: Mon, 20 Feb, 2023 at 12:25 PM

Primary rule: 

If the User (who logged in to send the SMS) is in the sub-account's My staff tab and has a Twilio Number assigned to himself or herself, the lead will get the SMS from the **Twilio number** **assigned** to that User. If the Twilio number is **SMS incapable** , we use **the default number** to send out the SMS instead.

Learn more about [Phone numbers for users / Assign Twilio Numbers to Users](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001152124)

Go to sub-account **Settings** > **My staff** > Edit the user

Expand **Call & Voicemail Settings**

## If the User (who logged in to HL) is not inside that sub-account OR the User doesn't have a Twilio number assigned, we will first use

### **1\. Channel number (first Twilio number ever used with that contact)**

If that number got removed, we will then use:

### **2\. Default outbound number**

When we hover over the text messages in the conversation, we can click on the three dots to view **D****etails**. This helps to indicate which Twilio number is used when sending SMS.
