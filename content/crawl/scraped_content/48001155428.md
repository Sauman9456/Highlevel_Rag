# Memberships | How to connect your custom domain / subdomain

Modified on: Wed, 19 Aug, 2020 at 9:56 AM

You can connect your custom domain / subdomain with membership sites by going to the Settings > Custom Domain. You can also use a custom subdomain by going to Settings > Site Details.

Note:

The domain / subdomain you connect with your membership site needs to be unique, it cannot be used also with your funnels/websites or as your whitelabel domain.
