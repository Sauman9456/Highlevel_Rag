Sorry! nothing found for   

# Zapier

Modified on: Fri, 18 Feb, 2022 at 12:01 PM

**Note** : The HighLevel Zapier integration is now listed in Zapier as "LeadConnector".

**Please note:  **

    In this video around the **4:10-4:15 mins** mark, I said "new agency account" by mistake. I meant new subaccount for your agency. 
    
    The "**add account** " option (**2:35secs**) has been removed from LeadConnector. To create subaccounts via API please [see this guide](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001207048)
