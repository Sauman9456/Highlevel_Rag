# Stripe Troubleshooting | Why is my Stripe Plan not shown in the Funnel Products?

Modified on: Mon, 13 Sep, 2021 at 8:27 AM

Stripe products will not be shown in funnel directly. Please add the products in the settings > payments section first. And then, the products should show in the funnels as well.
