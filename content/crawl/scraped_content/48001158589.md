# **Method 2:  **

# **Using a button element in the builder**

There are 2 primary ways to link a specific section of a page to a button within the funnel/ website builder (circled in red). 

_**Option 1:**_** ****"Website URL"  **  
Ideal for linking across different funnel & website pages _._ This is achieved by inputting the page URL with the #CSS SELECTOR ID appended at the end.  

**Ex:** **[https://www.URL.com/funnelpath](https://www.url.com/funnelpath)**** _#CSS_** _ _**_SELECTOR_** _ _  
_(This will also work for subdomains)_

_**Option 2:**_**  "Scroll to element"**  
Ideal for linking sections __within the same funnel page_. _Please select "Scroll to element" option in the field below and select the section within the page you wish to anchor/ scroll too.

# Button Option 1 - Website URL

## 1\. Click on the button you wish to link a section too

In this example we will be linking a button to a section from another page within the system.

Please proceed to click on the button. A highlighted box (orange) will appear when the button is selected.

## 2\. Click on the dropdown menu located at the bottom of the left side

Click on the dropdown menu located at the bottom of the left side menu

## 3\. Paste the URL plus CSS Selector in the input field

Next lets grab the page URL and append the CSS selector ID to the end.

Ex: [**https://www.URL.com/funnelpath**](https://www.URL.com/funnelpath)** _#CSS_** _ _**_SELECTOR_**  
(This will also work for subdomains)

## 4\. Select the action you would like to happen when the button is clicked

If you would like your link to open in a new tab please toggle this on.

Make sure to hit "**Save** " in the top right hand corner and that's it.

# Button Option 2 - Scroll to element

## 1\. Click on the button you wish to link a section too

A highlighted box (orange) will appear when the button is selected.

## 2\. Click on the "Button Actions" dropdown menu located at the bottom left side

## 3\. Click on "Scroll to Element" dropdown

## 4\. Hover and click on the section you wish the button to be anchored too

When scrolling through the options in the dropdown menu you will notice a highlighted box appears around the element (blue in the case). Select the element you wish to anchor the button too.

**Note:  **

    The titles in the dropdown menu are auto generated element names. If you would like to label your sections see **Step 5** below.

# **Method 3:  **

# **Using the Navigation Menu element in the builder**

**Important Note:**

Navigation menus are global elements, meaning they can be clicked on anywhere they are present. 

For this reason **we recommend** using the URL+CSS selector method to ensure that your links do not break.

  * **Ex:** ****<https://www.URL.com/funnelpath>****_#CSS_** _ _**_SELECTOR_****

###   

## 1\. Click on NAVIGATION MENU element

For this example we will anchor the "Book a Call" option to a booking widget section located in another funnel/ website.

## 2\. Click on the edit pencil next to "Book a Call" located in the left side menu area

###   

## 3\. Click on "Go to website URL"

Paste your redirect URL+CSS Selector: 

**Ex** : **<https://www.URL.com/funnelpath>****_#CSS_** _ _**_SELECTOR_**

 _(This will also work for subdomains)_

## 4\. Open link in New Tab?

For this option if you would like to open the link in a new tab please toggle this feature on  (blue). 

## 5\. Click on Submit

Make sure so hit "Save", that's it!  
  
Your Navigation Menu will now open your booking widget in a new tab.
