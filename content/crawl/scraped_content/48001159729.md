# Script not working? - Custom Javascript / HTML Code Validation Error Troubleshooting

Modified on: Tue, 8 Nov, 2022 at 6:19 AM

If your custom code has the <script> tag within a <div> tag, please cut the script tag and paste it below the <div> tag so that both tags are separate. The <script> tag does not work within a <div> tag as per our funnel/website builder settings.
