# HighLevel Group Calendar Overview

Modified on: Fri, 15 Mar, 2024 at 7:41 PM

    ****In a continued effort to improve the calendar feature from August 2022, several optimizations have occurred.****
    
    ****Please find below the changes that have been introduced****

* * *

## **What's Changed:**

* "Team" calendars are now referred to as "Group"

* You can use Group Calendars for scenarios where a user has multiple types of meetings and would like a way to view all of the options on a single page.

* Adding a Group calendar is now done within the _calendars settings tab_

* Users are directly added to their respective Calendars within the _Team & Event Step_ in the calendar modal.

* The two options for assigning contacts (listed below) have moved to the _Confirmation tab_  

  1. Assign contacts to their respective calendar team members each time an appointment is booked
  2. Skip assigning contact if the contact has already an assigned user

* * *
