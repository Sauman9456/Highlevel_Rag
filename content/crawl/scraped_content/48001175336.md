# Mailgun Setup Checklist

Modified on: Tue, 27 Sep, 2022 at 10:58 AM

# **Quick Setup/Troubleshooting Checklist For Mailgun + HighLevel**

A Guest-Tutorial From Krystin Ruschman of [](https://help.email-2-inbox.com/calendar-chat)[Email-2-Inbox](https://help.email-2-inbox.com/calendar-chat)

* * *

## **Are You Signed Up For The Right Mailgun Account?**

  * Foundation 50k is the minimum plan level necessary (Flex “Pay as you Grow” plan _does not_ include _Replies_)

## **Have You Configured Your Sending Subdomain Correctly In Mailgun?**

  * Create a subdomain from your chosen root domain (ex: reply.yourdomain.com)

  * Add the DNS records provided by Mailgun into your domain settings

  * Verify the DNS records in Mailgun (give time for your DNS records to propagate)

  * Under Sending > Domains, verify “green checkmark” shows next to the subdomain 

  * Under Sending > Domain Settings, turn on Click Tracking and Open Tracking; Turn on Unsubscribes, if desired 

  * Update **Tracking Protocol** to HTTPS (this creates an SSL certificate for your subdomain, so if your root domain SSL is expired or compromised in some way, the _links in your emails will still work_)

  * Under Receiving, ensure a Catch-All Route is configured with the HighLevel webhook (Note: This route should auto-create once your Mailgun API key and subdomain are configured inside HighLevel)

## **Is Your Sending Subdomain Set Up In HighLevel Correctly?**  

  * Under Agency View > Settings > Mailgun, ensure the API key and subdomain are associated with the desired sub-account

  * Switch to a **Sub-Account**  > Head in the **Sub-Account**  Settings,> Click on the SMTP and Mailgun Service, ensure the desired subdomain is showing and defaulted as the Default Provider

  * BCC Emails field – only if you want ALL OUTGOING emails from HighLevel to also go to an outside account

  * Forwarding Address – only if you want ALL INCOMING replies to also go to an outside account

  * Forward to Assigned User – only if assigning Users to Contacts and/or Campaigns and want ALL INCOMING replies to also go to an outside account

**NOTE:  **

    For BCC and Forwarding actions, please note that using an outside account to interact with HighLevel emails will break the Reply Route, so _NO_ further email replies will show in HighLevel Conversations for that email chain. If you want all email communication to show in HighLevel make sure you/your clients are not interacting with them from an outside account.

## **Have You Configured Your "From Name" and "From Email"?**    

  * HighLevel needs to know the Name and Email Address of who your emails should be from. Below is the hierarchy of how HighLevel looks for that information. Once it finds a value, it will stop looking and use the value it found:

  1. Contacts > Bulk Request > “Send Email” icon > From Name and From Email (if applicable)

  2. Workflow > Individual Email (or Campaign Configuration if using Campaigns) > From Name and From Email
  3. Workflow > Settings > From Name and From Email

  4. Assigned User
    1. If using Campaigns, HL looks to Campaign Configuration > Assigned User first (will use the Name and Email address associated with their user profile)
    2. If not using Campaigns, HL looks to Contact > Assigned User (will use the Name and Email address associated with their user profile)
  5. Company Name and Company Email address

## **It's Still Not Fixed!**

  * Aside from the basic setup, there are countless factors that play into email deliverability, making it virtually impossible to troubleshoot from a checklist. 

  * If you’ve gone through each step above and are still experiencing issues, please book a call with Krystin at Email-2-Inbox [](https://help.email-2-inbox.com/calendar-chat)[by clicking here](https://help.email-2-inbox.com/calendar-chat).

* This checklist may not be an inclusive list and is intended for educational purposes only 

* Correct configuration of email setup in HighLevel, MailGun, and DNS is the sole responsibility of the account owner, and should be validated through thorough testing 

* Setup according to this strategy is at the sole discretion of the account owner
