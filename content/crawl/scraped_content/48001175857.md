To create custom Unsubscribe Links:

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * 1\. Create a landing page with messaging you want people to see when they unsubscribe
  * 2\. Use the url to the landing page from Step 1 to make a Trigger Link. Learn more about Domain Setup (Funnels & Websites)
  * 3\. Replace the default unsubscribe link url with the Trigger Link
  * 4\. Create a workflow that uses "Trigger Link Clicked" as the condition and "Set Contact DND" as the action
