If you are not able to use our tool to move numbers ([Moving Numbers tool across sub-accounts](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001203968)), you will need to checkout the steps below:

Twilio phone numbers can be easily transferred between different projects by the Twilio Support team. To request this change, please gather the following information:

  * **Phone Number(s)** : The full phone number(s) you wish to move.
  * **Losing Account SID** : The AC SID for the project or subaccount that is giving up the phone number.
  * **Gaining Account SID** : The AC SID for the project or subaccount that will be receiving the phone number.
  * **Time frame** : The requested time frame for your change to complete (ASAP or a future date).
  * Regulatory Requirements (if required):
    * As Twilio does not transfer bundles, 

If you need to transfer a NON US / Canada number,  we will need to create a bundle/address on the project or subaccount that will be receiving the phone number.

Once the Twilio support team moves the number into the correct sub-account within your agency's Twilio account, you will see the number in HighLevel > Client Sub-Account > Settings > Phone Numbers.

# **Step 1: Identify the Twilio account credentials**

You can identify the Account SID in the Agency Settings > Phone Integration page > [](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/phone_system)<https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/phone_integration>

E.g. If I want to move a number from the sub-account **Appointment** to **Onboarding demo snapshot** , 

# **Step 2: To get the Account SID, click on the pencil icon on the right highlighted here:**

# **Step 3: Copy the Account SID here:**

If the losing and gaining projects have different owners, Twilio will need approval from each side, so **both account owners will need to  ****[Create a support ticket with Twilio support](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048500694-Contacting-Twilio-Support)**** **
