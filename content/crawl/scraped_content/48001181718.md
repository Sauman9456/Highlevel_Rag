# Call forwarding number not working

Modified on: Wed, 22 Feb, 2023 at 3:55 PM

Checklist:

1\. Is the call routing correctly to the right forwarding number you want the calls to forward to?

<https://gohighlevelassist.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48000981432-inbound-call-routing-explained>

2\. Is the forwarding number available to take calls now?

3\. Try to disable the call connect feature as the forwarding number might treat them as robotic calls and decline the connection

4\. If it's still not working, here's [How to check logs for a specific Call in Twilio](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001229978)
