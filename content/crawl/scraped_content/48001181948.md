# When {{appointment.start_time}} or any other appointment custom values are not showing up

Modified on: Tue, 27 Apr, 2021 at 6:24 PM

When **{{appointment.start_time}}** or **any other appointment custom values** are not showing

Or When the appointment reminder campaign is not firing properly according to the appointment start time:

Or when the Add to Google calendar / Add to iCal/Outlook link is not working when sending a test email.

We will need the **Appointment** or **Customer booked appointment** trigger in order for the **{{appointment.start_time}}  **or **any other appointments custom values** to show up. To test the Custom Values, you will need to book an actual appointment.

If you use the **Pipeline stage changed** as the trigger, HighLevel won't know which appointment it is.

Same with Workflows:

We need to use **Appointment** or **Customer booked appointment** as the workflow trigger:

To test the Custom Values, you will need to **book an actual appointment**.

If you need to manually add the lead to the **Appointment Reminder** Campaign, you will need to select the **appointment start time** as the **event start date.**

To reschedule manually, you could go to the **Appointments** tab on the right and switch **Confirmed** to **Reschedule**. This will automate the process of removing the leads out of the original appointment reminder campaign and re-adding them to the appointment reminder campaign again with the new appointment time.

If you want your leads to be able to reschedule themselves, you could choose the **reschedule link** from the Custom Values in the appointment reminder campaign:
