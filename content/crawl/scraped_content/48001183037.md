The Agent Reporting feature is available on the [Agency Pro plan](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001180534).

    For most customized reports, please refer to our custom dashboards where you can add and modify custom widget to display metrics from key areas of HighLevel. More information on this feature is available in [Custom Widgets help document](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001212-feature-document-custom-widgets).

You can access this report through the left-hand menu under "Reporting" > "Agent Reporting" (top menu)

The report includes:

  * Overview of how the entire team is performing at a glance.
  * Opportunities view showing stats, conversion stats, SMS stats, email stats, call metrics, and efficiency.
