# When contact detail page is Missing Activity

Modified on: Thu, 6 May, 2021 at 6:17 PM

Our developer, Malde dives deep into this and added more logs to troubleshoot further to find the following reasons:

One reason why attribution activity is missing from the contact details might be because the lead fills out the form using iPhone/safari. And this issue happened because the User turns on the option to block all the cookies when form submission happens.

Here is the reference link: <https://support.apple.com/en-in/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac>

And one other case where we can't track activity, If

?notrack=true

params are present on the URL. ex: 

<https://test.com/?notrack=true>

Cookies and local storage permissions are required. We are storing user's activity and server session-id on the browser's local storage. If session-id does not store on their local storage or if we can't access it, we can't store contact activity.

For the notes: we are storing every activity but not assign them to contact if the session is not stored or access.
