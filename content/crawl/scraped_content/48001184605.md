# Setting alias for Google smtp

Modified on: Thu, 9 Feb, 2023 at 1:26 PM


0:01 In this video, I'm gonna walk you through how to set up alias for your Gmail. So once you integrate your Gmail account within high level, when you're trying to send email, whether or not in automation or manual con conversation here, this is gonna be your user login email, and you're gonna have to change
0:22 it every time to match up with your default provider here. So because you integrate this Gmail as the default provider, this is gonna have to be the sender email because that's the limitation for each SMTP provider is that you will not be able to send from an address that's not verified
0:42 , or if that's not like added as an alias. So one way what we can do is to add alias, right?
0:50 So I'm gonna walk you through how to do that. So once you're in your Gmail account, make sure it matches with the email that you integrate with.
1:02 Go to settings on the top right and then click on see all settings. Go to the accounts and import tab, and this is where you can add another email address 
1:24 That you own or what you can do here. Let's just save if my email is Kate go high level.com, then I can add my colleagues' email.
1:33 For example, David go high level.com here. So let's just save, your colleague is trying to send an email fromDavid@gohighlevel.com, but the, the account that you integrate with is Kate go high level.com.
1:45 So what you can do is to add your colleagues' email here and then get your colleagues' email to verify. So you can send from your Kate go high level.com as the Gmail provider.
1:58 And then your users with David go high level.com is the user email, which it will show up in the conversation here.
2:06 Then he'll be able to send from his email because you're, you're adding his email as the verified sender. So it's like an alias.
2:16 So here I'm just gonna do another Gmail that I have and we are gonna do next step send verification. And here you will get a verification email.
2:29 It looks like this, and then you can copy the code and then paste it here, click verify. And there you go.
2:39 Now you can send from this email address that's different from the one that you integrate with, 
2:50 And this is what it's gonna look like, the sender email. It's gonna be from the one that you just added, which is gonna be different from the one that you integrate with high level.
