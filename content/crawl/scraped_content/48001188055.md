## **To Convert an existing Sub Account To SaaS Mode:**

  * In your Agency account > Accounts tab, scroll to the sub-account you want to convert, select the three-dots icon on the right-hand side of the listing, and select "Switch To SaaS"

## **If customer does not exist in Stripe yet:**  

  * In the modal that pops up, select the "Share Link" option, click on 'Copy Link' and then click on 'Convert to SaaS' button. Then ask your client to upload their card on the link.

## **If customer already exists in Stripe** :  

  * In the modal that pops up, select the "I already have this customer in Stripe" option, search and select the customer, hit continue, and you will then be prompted to choose which plan from your SaaS Configurator you'd like to move that client to.

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  * **What should I do if the “Share Link” option is not working or is unavailable?**

    * If the “Share Link” option is not working, first ensure that your browser or network settings are not blocking the pop-up or the link itself. Try using a different browser or clearing your browser’s cache. If the issue persists, check if there are any restrictions or permissions set within your HighLevel account that might be affecting this functionality. You can also contact HighLevel support for further assistance.
  * **Can I switch an existing sub-account to SaaS mode if it has pending invoices or unpaid balances?**

    * Yes, you can switch an existing sub-account to SaaS mode even if there are pending invoices or unpaid balances. However, it’s generally good practice to resolve any outstanding balances to avoid complications with billing and account management. Ensure that all financial matters are up-to-date to ensure a smooth transition.
  * **How can I track the status of the SaaS Mode conversion process for my sub-accounts?**

    * To track the status of the SaaS Mode conversion, you can monitor the sub-account’s status within your HighLevel dashboard. Look for updates or notifications related to the conversion process. If you do not see any changes or updates, verify that the process was completed successfully. You may also need to check your Stripe account to confirm that the subscription has been created and is active. For detailed tracking, consider reaching out to HighLevel support if you encounter any issues.
