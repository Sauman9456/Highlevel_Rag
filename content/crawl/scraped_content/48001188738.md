# LC Email / Mailgun replies not working when using WIX as the domain provider

Modified on: Thu, 27 Jul, 2023 at 12:34 PM

Where did you get the domain for WIX?

You will need to follow this article in order to set up your nameservers so they are not managed by WIX.

[**https://support.wix.com/en/article/dns-records-needed-to-connect-your-domain-to-wix**](https://support.wix.com/en/article/dns-records-needed-to-connect-your-domain-to-wix)

**Change** the nameservers here:

And then choose **I will use GoDaddy Nameservers**
