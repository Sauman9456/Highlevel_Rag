## **What is the Outlook Calendar integration?  
**

Outlook Calendar integration with the CRM is a powerful feature that enables users to synchronize their Outlook Calendar with the platform. This integration allows users to access their Outlook Calendar events in the CRM, ensuring they have all their appointments and meetings in one place. With this integration, users can connect their Outlook account to the CRM and configure their calendar settings to sync their calendar data seamlessly. Users can access their Outlook Calendar events from within their account, manage them directly, and create new appointments that will be reflected in their Outlook Calendar. 

### **What are the benefits of this integration?**

  * Syncing Outlook Calendar with the CRM enables users to access their appointments and meetings in one place, eliminating the need for manually switching between different applications.
  * Users can manage their Outlook Calendar events directly from the CRM, which saves time and effort and enhances their productivity.
  * Configuring calendar settings in the CRM ensures seamless synchronization of calendar data, which enables users to stay on top of their schedules and never miss necessary appointments.
  * Users can create new CRM appointments reflected in their Outlook Calendar, ensuring that all data is current across both platforms.

###   
**Who will benefit the most from this integration?**

The Outlook Calendar integration with the CRM benefits users and businesses that rely heavily on scheduling appointments and managing calendars. This includes sales and marketing teams, project managers, small business owners, and professionals who manage their schedules across multiple platforms. Users using Outlook Calendar to manage their appointments and meetings will find this integration particularly useful.

**Please Note:**  

    - The integration supports only Office 365, Outlook.com, live.com, or Hotmail calendars.   
    - Only one Outlook account can be connected to one user in a single location. If the same   user exists in another sub-account within the same agency under the same email address, they would be able to connect the same Outlook Calendar in that sub account as well.   
    - Outlook Integration works only for Group Calendars.

## **How to connect to Outlook Integration?**

Navigate to **Settings >> Profile**, and you will find the Integrations section, and you can connect the Outlook account from There.

**Please Note:**  

    The user who is logged in and wants to integrate should be part of that sub-account and only in that case you can find the Profile in the Settings menu.

You will then be required to permit LeadConnector to access your Outlook Calendar. Proceed with that to continue.

## **How to configure my calendar to use Outlook Integration?**

Navigate to **Settings >> Profile >>, **and scroll down to the bottom right, where you will find Calendar Configuration. In the Calendar configuration, you have two segments.

  1. **Primary Calendar** : It reads all the calendar events from Google/Outlook and writes all the appointments to Outlook/Google.
  2. **Check for Conflicts:** It only reads calendar events from Google/Outlook.

### **Primary Calendar Configuration :  **

Click on the edit button under Primary Calendar to select your Outlook account. You'll find all your Outlook calendars in the dropdown, and you can choose one of the calendars to which you want to read and write. 

**Please Note:**

    If appointments are not syncing over from Outlook or to Outlook, plesae Edit the Primary calendar, choose **Do not sync events to the primary calendar > Save> Then reselect the same calendar. **This should resolve the syncing issue.

### **Check for Conflicts Configuration:**

Click the edit button under Check for Conflicts to find all your calendars in your Outlook account. Proceed to select the calendar that you want to check for conflicts.
