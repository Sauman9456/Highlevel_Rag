## **Why was this feature built?**

Online Listings by Yext is an incredibly powerful SEO tool that creates backlinks and ensures your client's Vital business info (address, operation hours, phone numbers, etc) is consistent across 70+ of the world's most reputable websites. 

Yext is a great complimentary service that can be deployed alongside your services and can be resold through HighLevel with a markup price of your choosing... cha chinggg!

Currently, if you wish to purchase Yext Premium directly from Yext it will cost $999/year with an _annual commitment_ \- <https://www.yext.com/pl/powerlistings/plans.html>. 

The HighLevel team negotiated to get an absolute rock bottom price with minimal commitment. The cost for agencies is $30/month with a _3-month minimum commitment._  

If you're looking for a quick way to drive more organic inbound messages, combine Yext's online listings with our [Google My Business chat widget](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001176043). This is something that's quick to set up and all businesses can benefit from.

#### Apart from the three ways mentioned above, many successful agencies do marketing campaigns & email promotions to sell more Online Listings to their client base.

### **

**  
**

****Note:****

     Once a user rejects the top banner notification we do not show it again to them.

# **How do I purchase Online Listing for my client?**

If order to purchase online listings on behalf of your client you will need to purchase this through your agency dashboard 

* * *

# **How does the billing work?**

**  
**

The Online Listing Reselling feature created 2 subscriptions in the background

  1. A subscription for _$X_ /mo in your Agency Stripe account so you can collect payments from your client each month _[$X_ depends upon the price that you have set]
  2. ### A subscription for $30 /mo in HighLevel so you can pay HighLevel

The $[X-30] is your profit each month which means additional recurring revenue. 

**  
**

****

## **  
**

* * *

# **Understanding the HighLevel invoice**

As your agency makes sales on different days during your billing period, your charges will get pro-rated on the next billing cycle.

We do pro-rated billing to ensure you receive a single invoice in the same billing period, even though the sales are made on different days within the month. 

Each invoice adjusts for the sales made in the previous billing cycle + prepay for the next billing cycle.

# **Best Practices**

There are some best practices to make sure you and your clients derive maximum value from Online Listings. 

Please login to Yext as mentioned in Q4 below. Once you are logged in, go to "Home" and check out the "Optimize Your Account" card.

# **Troubleshooting**

In some rare cases, the Online Listings might not work as expected. A few possible scenarios are covered below

##   

## **My listings are not live. I see an In-review message**

This happens when Yext has found a duplicate listing for the same address, phone number, or email ID. 

If you see an "in-review" message like the following then your client needs to write to [locationconflict@yext.com](mailto:locationconflict@yext.com) to claim their listing. 

Yext just needs a confirmation from the end business that they have discontinued the service from their previous provider and wants to be serviced by you. 

**  
**

****Note:****

     If this does not go in your favor, you and your clients will be refunded.   
      
    In the event you would still like to leverage Online Listings, it is best discuss with your client how to get the old listing removed and move to the new one (you).

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

* * *

## **My listings are not live. I see a Cancelled message on the screen**

This happens when Yext has confirmed that your client is in a contract with their previous provider and Yext can not move the listing from the old provider to the new one because of legal reasons. 

In all such cases please try reaching out to [locationconflict@yext.com](mailto:locationconflict@yext.com) and try all possible solutions. If this doesn't go in your favor you can reach out to our support team and we will process a refund for you.

## **My listings look wrong / my listings are waiting on customer / my listings are waiting on partner / all my listings are still processing**

In all such cases, the common reason is that you have a mistake in the form data that you or your client had submitted. 

The error could be in:

  1. Address field
    1. PIN Code is written in the address line field
    2. PO Box used instead of a real address
    3. Only Street Address used (Suite number, shop number missing)
  2. Business Name is improper
  3. The phone number is not valid
  4. email ID is not a valid email

**  
**

**As agency users, you can easily fix this issue by logging into the Yext account and fixing any errors.**

## **My client submitted the wrong data in the listing form. How do I fix it now?**

Agency users can log in to Yext to manage Yext listings**.  For this example, the location had filled a PO Box address and used an invalid email ID in their listing form. **

**  
**

**That's why all listings are stuck in processing and have not become live yet.**

**  
**

### **1\. Go to the location view - > Reputation -> Online Listings and click on the "Manage Listing" button on** **the top right.**

**

****Note:**  **

    That the button circled in red is visible only to Agency Users. Your clients can not see this button.

**

**  
**

Please enter the username & password to log in to Yext.

**  
**

****

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

### **4\. Once you log in to Yext go to Knowledge Graph - > Entities -> Select the correct Entity.**

**  
**

****

**  
**

**  
**

**  
**

### **5\. Now, in this case, we will fix the wrong address & email ID by modifying those fields and by hitting save**

**  
**

**Once the corrections are made, all listings will be resynced and you will see that in a few hours all listings will become live.  **

## **How can my Clients connect their GMB Page and Facebook account?**

Once you are added as an admin user, please log in to Yext as shown above and go to "Home" in the top nav. On the "Optimize Your Account" card you will see options to connect the FB & GMB pages.
