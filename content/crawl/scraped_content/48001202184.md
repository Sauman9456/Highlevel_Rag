# Import Products / Price From Stripe

Modified on: Tue, 20 Dec, 2022 at 3:58 PM

****

**Which pricing plans can be imported?**

  * **Recurring / Subscription  **plans only. One-Time prices cannot be imported, these need to be created in the system directly.
  * To import a plan/price from Stripe, it must be in Live mode (not Test mode)
  * "Metered" prices **can not be** imported when importing a recurring plan/price
  * Stripe plans/prices that have already been imported into HighLevel will not show as options when using the "Import From Stripe" function, as they have already been imported

**What are we doing while importing price from Stripe?**

  * Import stripe product (which is linked with price) & create in HighLevel if it doesn't already exist
  * Create price under that product
  * We will also create same product and price in Stripe TEST Mode and PayPal (if integration connected)

**There will be 3 types of pricing plans in your Stripe account.**

1\. Price which was created from the Agency level via the SaaS configurator:

  * Prices created via the SaaS Configurator will have an "Agency Plan" tag with the product and price name in product listing and product details page.
  * Prices created with the SaaS Configurator cannot be edited in HighLevel Payments
  * If you update a price directly in Stripe, the change will not be reflected in the HighLevel Product/price. 
  * If you need to change the price of a product created via the SaaS Configurator, edit the price in Stripe and then use the "Import From Stripe" button to import the new price, which will create a new HighLevel Product with an "Agency Plan" tag, which you can then go select in your Funnel or Website page settings. 

2\. Prices which were created by creating a product in HighLevel:

  * When a product is created in HighLevel, a corresponding plan/price will be created in Stripe
  * Any edits to HighLevel product pricing will automatically sync to Stripe
  * Any edits to Stripe pricing **will not** auto-sync to HighLevel. Changed pricing in Stripe would need to imported into HighLevel as a new product.

3\. Prices which were created by you directly in Stripe:

  * If you've created plans/prices in Stripe, you can use the "Import From Stripe" button to import them into HighLevel as HighLevel Products. 
  * If you need to edit an imported product's price, make the edit in HighLevel and the change will sync to Stripe.
  * If you edit an imported plan/price in Stripe, the change will not be reflected in the HighLevel product - you'd need to import the changed plan/price as a new HighLevel Product.
