# 301 Redirects For Domains

Modified on: Tue, 30 Jan, 2024 at 12:57 PM

To create 301 redirects, go to "Sites" > "URL Redirects" (in the top navigation menu)

The URL Redirect feature gives you four options for redirecting a domain:

  1. Redirect to another URL
  2. Redirect to a step in a funnel 
  3. Redirect to a page in a website
  4. Redirect to all paths (REGEX)

**

_Redirect Type: URL_**

Redirect one URL to a another url

**Notes** :

    The domain you are redirecting from must already be added to your HighLevel sub-account.
    
    In the "Path" field, follow the placeholder example, including a "/" in the field followed directly with the new path after the "/". 
    
    The "Target URL" needs be a full, valid URL.

**

_Redirect Type: Funnel  _**

The Funnel redirect, allows you to 301 redirect a url to a step in an existing funnel that is linked with a domain within the subaccount.

**_Redirect Type: website  _**

Website redirect allows you to 301 redirect a url to a HighLevel Website page. Only those websites that are linked to a domain can be used here.

##   

**_Redirect Type: ALL_**

Redirect all paths from one URL to all paths of another URL. It is particularly useful when you have a "www" domain (www.mydomain.com) and a root domain (mydomain.com) wherein you can keep all of your paths on one website within HighLevel (e.g. mydomain.com/about-us) and then redirect all paths from www.mydomain.com to the root domain, thereby including www.mydomain.com/about-us without having to add a redirect for each path or maintain two websites. 

*This is also known as a REGEX redirect.
