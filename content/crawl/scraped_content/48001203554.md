Modified on: Mon, 22 Jul, 2024 at 10:50 AM

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * 1\. Make sure that the microphone is allowed in the browser you are calling from
  * 2\. Check if the microphone is allowed for the HighLevel web page on your browser:
  * 3\. Check if there are any Google extensions (VPN) that might block the call dialling.
  * 4\. Check if it works using the Google chrome guest browser
  * 5\. Edit the Twilio number - Outbound Call Timeout - Make sure it's more than 20 seconds and more so it will dial for longer.
  * 6\. Try to log in to app.gohighlevel.com on your Mobile phone's browser, not the mobile app, and see if you can call from there using the cellular data instead of the wifi network.
  * 7\. Check if the TwiML app's location ID is correct if the location is already using a Twilio subaccount SID
