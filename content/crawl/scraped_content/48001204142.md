## **Payment Verification Process in Funnels**

**(Version 1)**

If you are on _**Version 2**_ of the page builder **[click here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204216)**

**Related article:**  [What's the difference between Version 1 & Version 2 of the page builders](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204164)

##   
 _**How Authorization works:**_

  * This, by default, is **not  **turned on and will require a couple of quick extra steps, covered below.
  * The system will remove the monetary value placed in the "authorized amount" from the client's bank account before crediting it later.
  * If the account does not have the funds during the authorization process, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step.
  * Upon authorization approval, the system will credit back the account for the amount used to authorize.
  * If you have any "Trial days" attached to the plan, those will kick in as soon as the card is authorized.
  * Funds may take up to 5 business days before being returned to the clients bank account.
  * It**  ONLY **works with _Subscriptions and Payment plans.__  
_  

**Note:  **

    If you would like to authorize payment before purchase for all your plans, this process will need to be repeated for each plan attached to the payment form.

## **Authorizing a payment using version 1 of the page builder**

**1\. Head into your funnel/ website builder**

Select the funnel step your products are attached to.

**2\. Click on Products**  

**3\. Click on the "Edit" icon to open up your product settings**

In this example, there are two plans where "Authorized payments" will need to be turned on (Monthly $149 & Yearly $1490).  

First, we will start with plan 1 (Monthly $149) then come back and repeat this process for plan 2 (Yearly plan $1490).

**4\. Click on Authorize Card**

**5\. Type the dollar amount you would like to "authorize."**

**Please Note:**

    Keep in mind the amount you place here will be deducted from the clients account. If the funds are unavailable they will not be able to proceed.   
      
    In this example: The system will take "$1" out of the clients account and then refund the "$1" back.   
      
    The refund process may take up to 5 business days before returning the amount taken.   
      
    ONLY works with Subscriptions and Payment plans.
