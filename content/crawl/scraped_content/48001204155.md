# How to fix when the Review Request Email is not sending

Modified on: Thu, 9 Dec, 2021 at 4:16 PM

# Once you are in the location subaccount:

1\. Check what SMTP they are using, if info@gohighlevel.com is connected in the SMTP integration, the user needs to log in as info@gohighlevel.com and send the review request.

2\. Check if the Email content has any Custom Values and check if they look good.

3\. If they use Mailgun, there might be a delay.
