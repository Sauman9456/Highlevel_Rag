****

In October of 2021, we introduced an upgrade to page builders (Websites & Funnels) that affected the way they interact with products. 

Pages built before this date will _not_ be labeled but are considered Version 1. Pages built after October, 2021 are _labeled_ "**Version 2** " (see image above).
