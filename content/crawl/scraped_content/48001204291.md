Here is the 4 step process to follow :  

**Step 1  **: Click the "Switch to Agency View" button. you will find it by clicking the dropdown on the top left corner on the sidebar.

**Step 2 :** Go to settings menu at the bottom of the sidebar.

**Step 3 :** Click the "Company" tab located on the sidebar.

**Step 4 :  **Look for "Company Address" field in the right side of the screen. There you can enter the Address, City, Zip Code, State etc. in the respective fields. Once done, be sure to click the "Update Address" button.
