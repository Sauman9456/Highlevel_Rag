# How do I find my Agency's Relationship Number?

Modified on: Mon, 14 Oct, 2024 at 6:14 AM

When you interact with our support, services, customer success or product teams they will request your Agency's Relationship Number. This allows us to distinctly identify your agency account so we can serve you better.

Your relationship number is a 7 digit number that looks like X-XXX-XXX

     _Note_ : All agency accounts will have different Relationship Numbers

**Here is the step by step process to find your agency's Relationship Number:**

Click the sub-account switcher at the top left corner of the side navigation bar

Click "Switch to Agency View" tab. 

Find "Settings" button at the bottom left corner of the side navigation bar.

Once you are inside settings menu, select "Company" option. There you can see the Relationship number in the "Company Data" field. The number can be copied using the box icon next to the relationship number.

**Method 2 :  
**

Alternatively, agency admins can also find it by clicking blue question mark in the top right corner of your screen.

    _Note_ : Only **Agency Admins** and **Agency Owners** have permission to view the relationship number.
