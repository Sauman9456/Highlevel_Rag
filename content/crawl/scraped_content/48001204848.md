# How do I find my Client's Location ID?

Modified on: Mon, 29 Jan, 2024 at 12:49 PM

When you interact with our support teams, they may request you to provide a location ID where you face a problem. Location ID is a unique ID given to every sub-account in your agency account. This helps us identify your client's account and narrow down out trouble shooting efforts. 

To locate the location ID please head over to location view -> settings -> business profile and the location ID will be visible as shown below

    Please do not share the location ID outside of your organization.
