# Converting funnels and websites with the new import feature

Modified on: Sat, 12 Feb, 2022 at 12:56 AM

# **Overview**

Ever wanted to convert or import a website or funnel page into a new funnel/website you're building? With the new import feature this can now be achieved on the fly. 

# ****

## **How does it work?**

**Step 1:  **Click on"**\+ Add New Step** " button to add a new page to your funnel or website, 

**Step 2:** A pop up will appear, continue to name your page and path

**Step 3:  **Click on "Create Funnel Step" to close the pop up

**Step 4:** A new modal window will appear in the funnel preview area, click on the "Import" button

**Step 5** : Select which page you would like to import and click "**import** "

# 

### **Please Note:**

  * #### In order to import or convert a funnel/website you first have to add a new step

  * #### Import Funnel / Website feature imports**  only a single** funnel step or a webpage

  * #### You may only _import an existing_ funnel step or website page within HighLevel

  * #### Does not import from other websites/funnel providers

  * #### Changes to any imported step/page will NOT affect the original step/page

  * #### The import feature will NOT import the products configured or the stats accumulated on the source funnel step. Products have to be configured again after the import

  * #### ****** You can import a control or variation step in a funnel as well

  * #### ****** If you want to run split test on websites, please import that pages into funnels and run a split test there.

####   

****** Split testing is available on PRO plans only
