# What will be the order of Email Provider we will use to send emails?

Modified on: Wed, 26 Jul, 2023 at 5:36 PM

# The order of Email Provider we will use to send emails:

# 1\. Sub-account Default Provider (Sub-account view)

2\. Email Settings for Locations (Agency view)

If no default provider is selected at the location level, it will be using the provider configured in Agency View. 

[](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/email_services)[](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/email_services)<https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/email_services>  

Setting up Mailgun for Locations:

  * You can configure each location with your client's own Mailgun or your mailgun
  * We can use the same Mailgun API and the same domain/subdomain for multiple locations
  * We can use the same Mailgun API and different domains/subdomains for multiple locations
  * We can use the different Mailgun API and domain/subdomain for multiple locations
  * You can also set up a unique domain/subdomain for each location to capture cold inbound emails. [Learn more about Cold Email Inbound Setup here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001185801-cold-email-inbound-setup).

Setting up LC email for Locations:

  * If you add the custom domain at the agency level, it will be used for all sub-accounts until you set up a custom domain at the subaccount level. In that case, it will use the subaccount one as the priority.

We have a new download feature for email service settings. This option is especially beneficial for users managing high volume accounts, providing an easier way to handle your email settings:

3\. Agency Default provider in Email Services tab (Agency view)

[](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/email_services)<https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/email_services>

  * Each new location will inherit the settings based on this configured Mailgun API key.
  * We will also use it to send the **email verification code**

4\. LeadConnector Email

If nothing is set up, We will use something similar to this subdomain to send and receive emails.
