# My CRM Data is Loading Slowly What Can I Do?

Modified on: Fri, 25 Feb, 2022 at 1:49 AM

#### If you or your customer are facing issue with your dashboard loading slowly or it takes a while for the data to show up on a specific module, please follow the troubleshooting steps below:

## **Step 1:  **Login using an **incognito window** and check if it is still happening. 

If this does not resolve the issue, it has something to do with the browser cache. _Please proceed to the next step below_

## **Step 2:** Ask the user to please **clear browser cache** and reload the page. The user will need to sign in again. 

To clear cache please paste the URL in your preferred browser. 

  * Chrome: chrome://settings/siteData
  * Edge: edge://settings/clearBrowserData?search=cache

    If you do not see your browser, please google further instructions on how to clear your cookies/ cache

 _If this does not work please proceed to the next step below_

## **Step 3:** If the issue is still happening, this might be because of an **extension(s)** installed on their browser. Ask the user to disable all the extensions and check again. 

_Proceed to step 2, if this step does not resolve the issue_.

## **Step 4:  **Try different browsers like Firefox or Safari or Chrome. If it still fails, follow the next step.

## **Step 5:  **Go to the page where you see this happening and **right click > Click on Inspect > Console > Take a screenshot of the error message that you see here and raise a ticket.**** **
