# How to deploy Yext directly without charging the client?

Modified on: Wed, 24 Jan, 2024 at 5:49 AM

If you wish to deploy Yext for your client but you do not wish to charge them, you can choose to purchase Yext online listings on their behalf. 

In order to do this, please visit agency view -> sub-accounts -> search for the account -> then click on "Manage Client" on the sub-account card

Then scroll down to the Yext reselling section. Acknowledge the check box and click on Pay now to proceed with direct deployment of Yext.
