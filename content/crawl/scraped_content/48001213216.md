# Regulatory Bundle and Address Creation for Sub-Accounts

Modified on: Tue, 27 Aug, 2024 at 12:24 PM

To help sub-accounts comply with local phone number regulations and minimize the risk of disruption to your phone system, we maintain an up-to-date, country-by-country guide on phone number regulatory requirements.

Local regulations often require providing adequate identity documentation to carriers or a local enforcement agency. _To avoid urgent escalations from regulators, we urge you to provide the required information for each country._

In this article, we will cover how and where to achieve this in-app

**TABLE OF CONTENTS**

  * Step 1. Head into the Sub-account > Click Settings (bottom left menu) > Phone numbers > Regulatory Bundle/Address
  * Step 2. On the top right click on Create to create regulatory bundle/address for the sub-account:
  * Step 3. Once all the information is submitted, we will coordinate and get the regulatory bundle approved.

Automated Regulatory Bundle and Address creation:

Introduced a new optimized flow for Regulatory Bundle/Address creation and management.  

Regulatory Bundle/Address in the Phone Numbers Page at a sub-account level (only visible to accounts who are on LC Phone), this will be visible to Agency and sub-account admins.

The agency and sub-account will be able to create the bundle/address from our UI and directly submit it to the Telephony partner without any wait time. 

  * With this, they will also have the capability to save them in the draft, delete them, and re-submit them in case of failure.
  * Failure reasons will also be shown on the UI to make it easier for them to re-submit.  

        Note: Regulatory Bundle is not required if you purchase phone numbers in USA or Canada

# **Step 1. Head into the Sub-account > Click Settings (bottom left menu) > Phone numbers > Regulatory Bundle/Address**

# **Step 2. On the top right click on Create to create regulatory bundle/address for the sub-account:**

Regulatory Bundle and Address List View:

The agency and locations users will be able to view the list of all the bundles and addresses that are submitted and their current status too.

    **This page will be visible to _all the sub-accounts_ that are on the LC - Phone System irrespective of their country.**

#   
**Step 3. Once all the information is submitted, we will coordinate and get the regulatory bundle approved.**

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

Why am I getting this Error: Request failed with status code 400?

The issue date should be in the format yyyy-mm-dd. e.g. 2018-12-28

The birth date should be in the format YYYY-MM-DD as well.
