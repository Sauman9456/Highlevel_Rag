**Introduction:**

Tracking your emails is an important part of being a good sender and learning about how your users interact with your email. Every Campaign provides basic statistics along with granular details.

# **Recipients**

The number of contacts that you requested to send emails

# **Successful Delivery**

The number of emails SMTP was able to confirm were actually delivered to a recipient.

# **Opened**

The total number of times your emails were opened by recipients.

# **Clicked**

The email recipient clicked on a link in the email, the CNAME record must be pointing to mailgun.org.

# **Soft Bounces**

The email was not delivered as the recipient's server is unavailable or their inbox is full.

# **Hard Bounces**

The email was not delivered as the email address was not existent or blocked email address.

# **Unsubscribed**

The number of recipients who have unsubscribed from your emails. Unsubscribe events are triggered when the end recipient clicks the unsubscribe appended in the email footer. [Note - Once the contact has unsubscribed, it will not be possible to send the email to them. It would require a special request with acceptable reasons as the contact will have made a diligent choice to unsubscribe]

# **Failed**

This happens when the API keys are not valid, the user needs to configure the valid API keys or the number of recipients that you sent emails to, who have malformed email addresses, or whose mail provider reported the address as invalid.

# **Spam**

The number of recipients who have marked your email as spam.

There is a button named Load more statistics with the details of **Recipients that delivered, opened, clicked, unsubscribed, spam, or failed.**

# Where will email statistics show for every email activity?

## **Workflow email stats**

Click on the Email step -> Click Statistics on the top right

## **Campaigns email stats**

Make sure that the date filter includes the date range you are looking for. When stats suddenly go missing, usually it's because the stats are in the last year/month.

SMTP integration will show opened and clicked only, we will not be able to fetch delivered/bounced stats.

Only mailgun will be able to show full stats

## **Bulk actions email stats**

Click on the **Successful %** to view more statistics
