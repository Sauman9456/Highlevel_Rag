# How to change the Content of An Ongoing Email Campaign

Modified on: Wed, 25 May, 2022 at 7:09 AM

There are many times when an **ongoing email campaign for Schedule, RSS Schedule  and Batch Schedule Delivery has content errors like spelling mistakes, text changes, or link changes to meet the standards of the brand.** 

There are times when the stats are very important, it is impossible to delete the campaign. _With this change, the user will be able to change the content for ongoing email campaigns_ for Simple Schedule, RSS and Batch Schedule before the next execution date. 

The user will be required to visit the **Marketing > Email**. Please visit the**  Email Campaign tab, it will have a list of Email Campaign listed with Schedule, RSS Schedule and Batch Schedule which are ongoing and has the execution dates mentioned.**  
  
There will be option in**  Actions > Update Email Content. **

In the action button, there will be an option of Update Email Content. The user can make the changes to the details of the email like changing the elements or words. Once the changes are done, they will be required to Save Edits.  

    Note: We are not 100% sure that the copy will get changed before the emails go for the next execution on the server.
