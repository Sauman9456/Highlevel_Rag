Modified on: Fri, 4 Oct, 2024 at 8:31 AM

Rescheduling of Email Campaign is possible for Simple Schedule, Batch Schedule, and **RSS Schedule one hour (60mins) ahead of the execution date.  **

The user will be required to visit Marketing > Email. Please visit the Email Campaign tab: it will have a list of Email Campaigns listed with Simple Schedule, RSS Schedule, and Batch Schedule, which can be rescheduled one hour after

 the execution date/time.
