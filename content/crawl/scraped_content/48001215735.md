# Grouping of Social Media Profiles

Modified on: Wed, 25 May, 2022 at 11:11 AM

There are times when there are multiple social media profiles or networks. It becomes tough to select each time social profiles while creating a new post. It would become a lot faster to select them all at once with Social Grouping. 

# **How to create a Social Group?**

It can be created from the overview page of Social Planner or while creating a new post or in Settings of Social Planner, user can manage the social accounts inside the group. 

## Each Social will become unique inside the group.

### **Step 1:** Click on **Add Group**

### **Step 2:** Enter the Group Name

### **Step 3:** Click on **Add accounts to group  **and**  select your social channels **

### **Step 4:** Click on **Add Group**

### **Step 5:** If needed, you can **edit** the** ** Group by clicking on the **pencil icon**
