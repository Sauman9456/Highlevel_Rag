## **What is this Feature?**

****  

Local Services Ads is a Google advertising service that helps service businesses (like plumbers, electricians, etc.) advertise their services on Google. When potential customers search for a specific service on Google, ads from local service providers appear at the top of the search results.

Reserve with Google, on the other hand, is a Google service that lets users book appointments and reservations with service businesses directly from Google Search, Google Maps, or the Reserve with Google website.

Integrating LSA (Reserve with Google) with the CRM allows businesses to advertise their services and allow potential customers to book appointments directly through Google. This provides a streamlined customer experience and can help businesses reach more potential customers, increase their booking rates, and better manage their appointments.

### **Usage Cases:**

**Home Service Businesses:  **Businesses offering home services such as cleaning, landscaping, or plumbing can use this integration to reach their local audience efficiently. Whenever users in their service area search for these services, their business will show up at the top of the search results, providing high visibility. Once a user hires the service, they can directly schedule an appointment through Google. This eliminates the need for back-and-forth phone calls or emails, accelerating the booking process and leading to a better user experience. The integration can also help businesses manage their bookings, avoid double-booking, and keep track of customer details and preferences for future reference.

**Real Estate Agencies:** Real estate agencies can leverage this integration to reach a wider audience of potential buyers or sellers. Through Local Services Ads, they can advertise their services, such as property viewing, consultation, or legal paperwork assistance. When an individual is interested in a property or service, they can directly schedule a viewing or a meeting via Reserve with Google. This simplifies the user's journey from discovering a property to booking a viewing and allows agencies to manage their viewing schedules effectively.

**Legal Consultation Services:** Law firms can use this integration to advertise their consultation services. When users search for legal consultation in their local area, the law firm's ad will appear at the top of the search results, increasing its visibility. Potential clients can then book a consultation directly through Reserve with Google, providing a streamlined booking experience. By reducing the barriers to booking a consultation, law firms can convert more potential clients while managing their consultation schedules effectively.

## **FAQs**

### **1\. How can agencies best leverage Local Services Ads for their clients?  **

 Agencies have various ways they can leverage LSAs for their clients. Some agencies charge a setup fee, ranging from a hundred to a thousand dollars, to set up the LSA account, then a monthly maintenance fee. Others charge a percent of total revenue or even offer the setup for free to acquire new clients. There is no one-size-fits-all approach and the strategy used would depend on the agency's model and the clients they target.

### **2\. How does the onboarding process work for agencies?  **

Google offers support for agencies when it comes to onboarding. If an agency has multiple accounts (10 to 1000+), there is a dedicated account management team to provide support. They also provide a phone number for general onboarding and account management support. A bulk upload process is also available for creating multiple locations at once.

### **3\. What is the hierarchy for setting up LSAs?  **

When setting up LSAs, a business should create a manager account, after which they can create Customer IDs (CIDs) through the manager account flow.

### **4\. Who qualifies for the high-level integration of LSAs?  **

The CRM's integration of LSAs is available to everyone, not just Pro users. 

### **5\. Can I connect different Google accounts to different businesses within the CRM?  **

You can log in if you can access their Local Services Ads sign-in account. 

### **6\. What requirements must a business meet to be eligible for LSAs?  **

The requirements for eligibility vary based on the service provided by the business. For example, if it's an HVAC business in California, Google will require a specific license and a certain amount of general liability insurance. If the business or master technician does not have the required license, they will not be eligible. Furthermore, background checks are required in specific verticals. If a business does not pass these checks, it won't be eligible for LSAs.

### **7\. What is the usual turnaround time for getting approved for LSAs?  **

 If a business can submit all the required documentation within 24-48 hours, approval may take one to two weeks. However, this varies based on the volume of applications and can be affected by other external factors. If a business has many employees who need to submit background checks, the process can take three to four weeks.

### **8\. How does the pricing structure of LSA work?  **

The pricing for Local Services Ads is based on a pay-per-lead model. Businesses only pay for valid leads and specific services related to their business. However, the cost per lead varies by job type, region, and lead type.

### **9\. What types of leads does LSA include?  **

Local Services Ads can include a range of leads such as phone calls, messages, bookings, and more. The exact types of leads a business will be charged for depending on their service.

### **10\. What happens when a business receives a lead from LSA?  **

When a business receives a lead, it can review the lead details. They can dispute the lead within the LSA dashboard if they believe it's invalid. They won't be charged for invalid leads.

### **11\. How can I get the integration for Local Services Ads on the CRM?  **

 While the integration is currently live behind the scenes at the CRM, it's only visible to specific users as the CRM awaits Google's approval for broader use. Once Google gives the thumbs-up, the integration will be flipped on for everybody.

### **12\. Can I accept Payments through Reserve with Google?**

No, Reserve with Google currently does not support payments. Despite enabling the 'Accept Payment' option on a calendar, payments cannot be completed for bookings made through Reserve with Google.
