## [](https://www.gohighlevel.com/priority-support-cancel-request)**FAQ**

**How do I request to cancel my Priority Support Upgrade? How do I downgrade to Standard Support?**

After you have filled out the [Priority Support Cancelation Request](https://www.gohighlevel.com/priority-support-cancel-request), we will respond to your request within 24 to 48 hours or less.

### **What if I am the owner of more than one Agency Account? Does a Priority Support Upgrade purchase enable it for all my HighLevel Agency Accounts?**

Priority Support Upgrade is valid for only one Agency account per active subscription. The one you sign up with is the only one you will use to receive the Priority Support benefit. You must purchase Priority Support for the specific agency you wish to enable Priority Support with .*Priority Support Upgrade does not work for sub-account or sub-location owners. As an Agency Owner, Agency Admin, or Agency User, you can receive Support related to anything in your Agency. Non-Agency Users cannot receive HighLevel Support. This is for the security, privacy, and protection of our clients and their Agency information. This means users with user permissions of Location Users and Location Admins cannot utilize or see the Priority Support Upgrade Widget. Only Agency Admins and Agency Users are provided any form of HighLevel Support upon verification. We support your Agency Users and Admins. We do not support Location Users. However, an Agency Admin or Agency User can receive Support for any sub-location or sub-account.__

### **Do I get a dedicated Support Rep or Point of Contact I can schedule 1-on-1 calls with or email directly?**

No. This service no longer offers a dedicated Priority Support Representative. You cannot book 1-on-1 strategy calls with Support or Success through this service. However, you will enjoy faster phone, chat, and ticket support - saving you time and money while accelerating your inbound support ticket request needs. We're excited to serve you as we continue to LevelUp your business together!
