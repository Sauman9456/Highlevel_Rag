# Workflow Folder Permission

Modified on: Fri, 2 Sep, 2022 at 4:00 AM

    Workflow folder permissions is only available on the [Agency Pro Plan](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001180534) & above.

## **Restrict access to any folder containing workflows with Folder Permissions**

**Folders allow you to organize content and workflows allow you to automate tasks. You spend hours putting together battle-tested workflows, the last thing you want is unauthorized changes.  **  
  
With folder permissions users without access, won't be able to see, create and edit any workflows within that folder. So, if the folder permissions are set to _agency admin_ , then only users with the _agency admin_ role can see, create and edit workflows.

## **How-to Add Folder Permissions Within a Workflow Folder**

     All users **regardless of thier folder permissions** will still be allowed to view the list of workflows the contact belongs to inside the Contact Details Page. Users will also have the ability to __**_add / remove_** contacts **_to/ from_** any Workflow.
