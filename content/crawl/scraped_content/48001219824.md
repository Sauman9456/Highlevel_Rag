# Step-by-step guide to set up Mailgun

Modified on: Tue, 23 Jul, 2024 at 1:39 PM

Mailgun Step-by-step guide:

**1\. Sign up for Mailgun here:**

<https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup>

**2\. Check your email inbox to verify the email address**

**3\. Click Sending > Add New Domain**

**4\. If your domain is companyname.com, you can either set up the main domain or subdomain with Mailgun.  **

  * Main domain:
    * If you are adding the main domain, it should not be used with Gsuite, or any other email provider
  * Subdomain:
    * To set up the subdomain with Mailgun, you can type **ANYTHING_HERE**.companyname.com
      * Examples:
        * mg.companyname.com
        * replies.companyname.com
        * support.companyname.com
  * Please set up the domain or subdomain under US, **not EU**.
  * Click **Add domain**

**5\. Now log in to your DNS records based on where you get the domain and add the 5 DNS records.**

  * If you are not sure where you should add the DNS records
  * Step 1: lookup domain that we are trying to set up in [mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx)
  * Only put the domain here, **do not add http:// in front**  

Once you look up the domain, it should show what your DNS hosting provider is.

  *   * Step 2: check the bottom note it will say reported by e.g. [wordpress.com](//wordpress.com)

  * Now we could add the DNS records to the domain provider. We can google **wordpress DNS records** if you are not sure where to locate the DNS records area.

Based on what your domain provider is, now we could add the DNS records according to the domain provider:

If you don't find the domain provider on this list, you can refer to one of the articles above, which should be similar.
