# How to use the client's own Twilio account for the location?

Modified on: Mon, 13 Feb, 2023 at 11:15 AM

In an event where your client sign up for their own Twilio account, here's how to use the client's own Twilio account for the location:

1\. Go to the **Agency view** > **Settings** > **Phone System**

[](https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/twilio)<https://app.gohighlevel.com/settings/phone_system>

2\. If the location already has a Twilio SID generated, we can click Update Credentials by clicking the three dots on the right to delete the connection:

3\. If the account SID and auth token provided by your client is a Twilio **Subaccount, you can then replace the Account SID and auth token here.**

If the account SID and auth token provided by your client is a Twilio **Master account,  **it's best to integrate with the subaccount.

How to create a subaccount inside Twilio:

<https://console.twilio.com/>

1\. Click the **Account** dropdown on the top right > **Subaccounts**

2\. Click on Create subaccount

3\. Type the location company name here and click **Create subaccount**

Once the subaccount is created, click the **Account Name** to go inside the subaccount.

**4\. Copy** the Account SID and auth token to the HighLevel Twilio settings:

Please reach out to Twilio support to help move the numbers if the number was in the master Twilio account:
