# **How to Create a Blog Page Within a Funnel or Website**

###   

## **Step 2: Add a Funnel or Website with the Blog Post List element**

**Please Note:**

     This funnel or website page is going to be your main Blog page which contains all your blog posts which have been added in the Blogs section.

1\. Create a new Funnel / Website or add a step/page to an existing one

2\. Once the funnel step is added, go to the edit button to land on the editor  

3\. Click on the element named Blog Post List

  * Choose the element and type of layout between Standard and Compact
  * Pagination refers to the number of blog posts shown on the landing page

            You can rename the 'More stories' button

**Please Note**

    It is recommended to add a Header (Navigation menu) and Footer links to your main blog page

The "**Blog Post List** " element has several options. _Blog type_ allows you to choose between "**standard** " or "**compact** ," the Pagination settings will enable you to select thetext will number of blog posts visible on the page, and the button options allow you to edit the button textwill, enable  

4\. Add Domain to the site from Funnel / Website Settings, if it is not already added

5\. If you want the blog page to open when you enter your Domain without any path

 _For example,_ blog.mydomain.com instead of blog.mydomain.com/home - Go to **Settings** > **Domains** > **Edit Domain** > Select the **blog page** as Default Page

**Please Note:**

    Category, Keywords, Author, and Slug **CANNOT** be updated _after_ the blog has been published. The developers working on a solution which will be released soon

## **FAQ's**

### **How does the domain work with the blog?**

The Domain will be added to the Funnel or Website where the blog list element is added.

_Blog URL formats:_

Domain| Slug of Blog Post| Final URL  
---|---|---  
[abc.com](http://abc.com)| b/sample-now| [abc.com/b/sample-now](http://abc.com/b/sample-now)  
[abc.com/xyz](http://abc.com/xyz)| b/sample-now| [abc.com/xyz/](http://abc.com/xyz/%20b/sample-now)[b/sample-now](http://abc.com/xyz/b/sample-now)  
[blog.abc.com](http://blog.abc.com)| b/sample-now| [blog.abc.com/b/sample-now](http://%20blog.abc.comb/sample-now)  

### **Can I have separate blog pages for each category?**

That is not currently supported. In the upcoming updates, we will allow users to create a funnel/website page based on a Category filter with the slug and SEO details.

### **How do you choose the number of blog posts displayed on the landing page?**

The Pagination settings allow you to select the number of blog posts visible on the page, and the button options will enable you to edit the button text. We would recommend keeping it to 6 or 9 blog posts.  

### **Is it optional to add an Author, Category, or Keywords**

Blog Post details require Category details like name, slug, and SEO details can be set in Blogs Settings. It is optional to add _Author_ and _Keywords_. Author details can be set in Blogs Settings with name, photo, and social information. Keywords can be set from the publish screen.

No, Custom Values are not supported in blog posts at the moment. You cannot use values like {{contact. name}} or {{custom_values.xyz}}

###   

### **How to add Forms, Surveys, or Custom Code to my blog post?**

Forms or Surveys cannot be added to blog posts at the moment. The option to add custom code will be out soon.

### **Why can't I change the blog author?**

Category, Keywords, Author, and Slug CANNOT be updated after publishing the blog.

### **Can I add more Fonts?**

Currently, this is not supported. We are working on providing more font options soon.

### **What is the recommended image size for a blog post?**

We don't have a recommended size. However, the page width inside the blog post editor is 736 px.
