# How to Add Category

Modified on: Thu, 24 Nov, 2022 at 1:07 AM

The category is an important component for Blog and Blog post content. It helps readers in finding things when they are categorized. Users will be required to create and add categories when the blog post is created. 

Categories are created from Blogs > Settings (gear icon beside create post button)  

**Please Note:**

    Category, Keywords, Author, and Slug **CANNOT** be updated _after_ the blog has been published. The developers working on a solution which will be released soon
    
    Category pages inside the blog are on the roadmap
