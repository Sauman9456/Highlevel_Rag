# Common uses cases for Payments and Invoices

Modified on: Thu, 16 May, 2024 at 5:11 PM

Payments are used to pay for goods or services. They can be made by credit card, debit card, bank transfer, cheque, cash, or any other method of payment. Invoices are used to record the amount that has been paid for a product or service. The invoice is usually sent with the payment so that it can be tracked as part of the accounting process.

# **Charging a card while on the phone with a customer without sending an invoice**

### **Step 1:  **Create an invoice by selecting the contact. If the contact does not exist, add the contact on the fly.

####   

### **Step 2:** Add the product that is being sold, if the product is _not listed_ in the dropdown, choose "**Add New Item** "

####   

### **Step 3:** On the invoice builder page, instead of sending the invoice, click on the _three dots_ at the top bar. Click on "**Record Payment** "

###   

### **Step 4:** On the next modal window, choose "**Charge a card** " and on the next screen, choose "_**New Card**_ " if this is a first-time customer.

###   

### **Step 5:** If this customer has already purchased, then the saved cards section will have the card used before.

####   
**Please Note:**

#### 

     Customers being charged will _not_ recieve any automated email/text confirmation.

# **Using invoices for recording manual payments _without_ Stripe Connect**

You can use invoicing solution without stripe connect as well. However, to receive any payments done via _credit/debit cards_ , Stripe Connect is needed.

**Please Note:**

     If you opt to use invoicing _without_ Stripe Connect you will are required to manually record and collect payments.  
      
    For now, recording _manual payments_ without Stripe Connect works only for **_one-time invoices._**

### **Step 1:** Navigate to Invoices under Payments Menu on the left side.

###   

### **Step 2:** The system will prompt you to add _Stripe Connect_. **Please close the popup.**  

### **Step 3:  **Proceed to create the new invoice via the "_New_ " button and choose "New Invoice". 

### **Step 4:  **On the invoice builder page, add the customer details, add the products/services sold, tax info, and discounts if any. Once you are ready click on the __three dots__ and choose the "**Record Payment** " option

### **Step 5:** Choose "_Record Manually_ "

### **Step 6:  **The next screen will show options like - Cash, Card, Check, Bank Transfer, and Other. Choose the option that applies and click "_Submit_ " on the next screen

### **Step 7:  **Now the invoice will be recorded for that customer 

#### **Please Note:**

#### 

     Customers being charged will _not_ recieve any automated email/text confirmation.
