# How to add Client Spend to Google/Facebook Ad Reporting?

Modified on: Mon, 5 Sep, 2022 at 9:05 AM

Client Spend setting is _only_ visible to the Agency Admin and Agency users. The Agency can set the markup value in the setting beside Client Spend. 

**Client Spend = Cost of all the ads + Management Fees  **

## Where to find and add Client Spend   

Add your monthly management fee to your client's ad spend. These markup fees will be added to all cost-related metrics.
