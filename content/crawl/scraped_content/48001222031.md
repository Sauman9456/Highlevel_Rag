# **To edit mobile styles in a drag-and-drop template**

The default styles include font size and line height settings that work well on a smaller screen for Design Editor (Drag and Drop Editor). You can make additional changes to these at any time.

To edit mobile styles in a drag-and-drop template - Design Editor, follow these steps:

## 1\. After creating an Email template or campaign, go to the Appearances

  * 

## 2\. Click the Appearance tab and choose Mobile Formatting

  1. 

## 3\. In Mobile Formatting, there are options for different styles, font heights, and alignment.

For font size or button style, the toggle needs to be enabled to apply for the mobile formatting.

    **Note -** The following settings will only work in the mobile version of the email template in email clients which support media queries.

  * 

## 4\. Once the settings are implemented for mobile, click the three dots after saving the template for preview in the mobile view.

### **Preview and test your email campaign**

Preview and test your email campaign on a mobile device to view the changes.
