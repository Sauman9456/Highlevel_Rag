Modified on: Wed, 24 Jul, 2024 at 2:23 PM

    If you are an existing client with Mailgun or SMTP integrated High Level, please follow the guide below.   
      
    If you are a '**New** **Agency'** and have **not** integrated any SMTP/Mailgun provider you are already on LC - Email by default.

LC - Email is designed to help agencies avoid the hassle of signing up for Mailgun or any 3rd party email service provider. In the past, when an agency signed up they would need to either integrate with Mailgun or another email service provider to send/receive emails.  
  
With LC - Email, sending & receiving email works right out of the box, on every subaccount. This article will help you migrate your Agency and sub-accounts over to the LC - Email.

    Clicking the '**Use LC - Email** ' button will **_not affect_** __**_sub-accounts_** that already have SMTP or Mailgun integrated, please follow the steps below to remove the **existing SMTP integration**.   
      
    After clicking the '**Use LC - Email** ' button _a_ _ll new accounts_ will automatically switch over to LC - Email. You can still configure new accounts away from LC- Email by integrating your own Mailgun or SMTP.

This domain (replies.example.com) is already configured inside a Mailgun account.

Login to Mailgun and delete it from there so you can use it in LC Email

Please [Create a New Support Request](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204857) if you believe the domain should be deleted.
