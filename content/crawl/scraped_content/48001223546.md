## **What is LC - Phone?**

LC - Phone acts as a Telephony service provider, which has Incredible **Deliverability, Error Monitoring, and Better Compliance** and is much more affordable when compared to any of the Telephony service providers.

##   
**Why was this feature built?**

We have developed a Phone ISV product (aka  LC - Phone System) to **stop the need for agencies to signup for Twilio and integrate it into the CRM**.

In the past, when an agency signed up for the CRM, they had to sign up for Twilio and integrate it into the CRM. Managing this requires relatively advanced knowledge, and not all agencies are comfortable doing it themselves. Like any other SaaS platform, the ideal solution is to have SMS/ Call work out of the box because that's how users expect a matured SaaS platform to work.  
Historically, configuring Twilio has been a major challenge for new Agencies regarding getting up and running. With LC - Phone, sending & receiving SMS/calls will work right out of the box.

##   
**Why switch to LC - Phone System?**

  * **Out of the box with one click.  **[Read More.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204027)**  
**
  * **Increased security** with [Ramp ups](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001213941-messaging-policy#1.-Ramp-Up-Model%3A) and real-time error monitoring. [Read More. ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001213941-lc-phone-messaging-policy)
  * **Increase delivery rate** with in-app features[Opt-out and SenderID addition, DND based on Error rates] [Read More.](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001213941-lc-phone-messaging-policy)
  * **Better Cost with real-time billing**[Quick realization of money]. 

  * **Reduces friction** to manage different platforms, most of the features are available in-app.

##   
**LC - Phone Pricing**

Pricing is exactly the same as Twilio, with a 10% discount on select categories. As there are a lot of product categories, you can find the major categories' pricing [here](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223556)[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223556)[](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223556).

Instead of paying Twilio, agencies will be charged using the payment method in the agency Billing tab.

The charges are outlined in the agency settings. You will be able to download the transaction logs from the agency settings page to analyze further:

You can go to **Agency settings - > billing tab** to look at your overall Twilio usage

You can also see detailed transactions by clicking on the **See Details > link**

On this screen, you will see usage from all of your locations combined. You can use the **export** button for internal audits. Learn more about [How do I analyze my Agency's Spend on LC Communications?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001225291)

For each location's usage, once you are in the location Settings, go to **Phone numbers** > **Usage Summary**
