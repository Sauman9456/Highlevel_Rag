## **Implementing Stripe Tax Management as a Workaround for SaaS Agencies**

In addition to the Tax Settings feature, SaaS agencies operating in regions like the EU, UK, and North America can benefit from implementing the Stripe tax management workaround. While a primary tax management solution is being developed, integrating Stripe Checkout and its Tax management service can temporarily simplify tax management and ensure compliance with regional tax regulations. This workaround offers flexibility, accuracy, and improved customer experiences during transactions.

The Stripe tax management workaround involves configuring tax categories like VAT or Sales Tax in Stripe for your SaaS products, offering flexible pricing options that include or exclude taxes. Using Stripe's Tax management service, SaaS agencies can provide a seamless checkout experience, displaying taxes transparently to prospects during transactions. Moreover, this approach simplifies tax compliance by ensuring adherence to tax laws in target regions.

**Please Note**

     The Stripe tax management workaround is currently available only for SaaS direct payment links and is not supported on funnel sales yet. As this method serves as a temporary solution, a more comprehensive tax management solution is expected to be developed to support all aspects of your SaaS business.

## **FAQs**

### **How do I handle tax exemptions for specific customers using the CRM Tax Settings feature or the SaaS workaround?**

Answer: For the CRM Tax Settings feature, create a tax with a 0% rate and apply it to the exempt customer's invoice. For the SaaS workaround, create a custom tax rate with a 0% rate in Stripe and apply it to the exempt customer's subscription.

### **Can I use multiple tax rates with the CRM Tax Settings feature and the SaaS workaround?**

Answer: Both methods allow you to create and apply multiple tax rates for different products, services, or customer locations. You can add various taxes to an invoice in the CRM Tax Settings feature. In the SaaS workaround, you can select the appropriate tax rate when editing a customer's subscription in Stripe or configure your third-party Stripe integration to apply the correct tax rate during checkout.

### **What happens if a customer changes their location or billing address?**

Answer: You must update the customer's tax rate based on their new address for both methods. In the CRM Tax Settings feature, update the taxes on their invoice. For the SaaS workaround, update their subscription in Stripe and configure your third-party Stripe integration to automatically update tax rates during checkout.

### **Can I apply taxes to one-time purchases using both methods?**

Answer: By adding taxes to an invoice, you can apply taxes to one-time purchases using the CRM Tax Settings feature. With the SaaS workaround, create tax rates in Stripe and use a third-party integration that supports dynamic tax calculation during checkout.

### **How do both methods handle refunds?**

Answer: For the CRM Tax Settings feature, adjust the tax amounts manually on the refunded invoice. With the SaaS workaround, Stripe will automatically calculate and refund the correct amount of taxes based on the original transaction.

### **Can I generate tax reports using both methods?**

Answer: The CRM Tax Settings feature does not directly provide tax reports, but you can export invoice data, including tax information, and use third-party tools or accounting software to generate tax reports. For the SaaS workaround, export transaction data from Stripe and use similar tools or software to create tax reports.

### **How do I handle tax changes or updates using both methods?**

Answer: For the CRM Tax Settings feature, update the tax rates in your tax list and apply the updated rates to new invoices.
