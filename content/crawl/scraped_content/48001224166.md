## Why build Agency Rolled-up Reporting?

Agency rolled-up reporting gives you a full view of all your accounts under one roof. With this report, you get a clear overview of your entire agency's performance. The goal is to provide agency owners with data and insights that enable them to take informed decisions about their company and improve the performance of their sub-accounts.

##   
How does it work?

Rolled-up reporting allows you to roll up any account into another account. For instance, if you want to know how many leads came from Facebook Ads, you can simply roll up your Facebook Ads account into your main account.

##   
When should I start using it?

As soon as it's accessible in labs! Knowledge is power and within that lies great opportunity. Rolled-up reporting allows you to compare your overall marketing and automation performance across multiple sub-accounts anytime.

##   
Here are some benefits of rolled-up reporting:

  * You can easily spot trends and patterns in your data
  * You can quickly analyze your performance over time
  * You can easily track changes in your performance

In conclusion, rolled-up reporting helps you to gain insights into your agency's performance.
