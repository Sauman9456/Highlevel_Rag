## **What is Split Testing?**

Split testing is valuable technique marketers use to refine their website funnels and maximize conversion rates. A/B testing enables you to compare various web page or funnel versions to identify the best performance. Split tests allow you to create a funnel page with several variations and then link to it. You can assess the probabilities that a lead will visit page version A or B. By measuring the conversion rate over a certain period, you can compare the performance of different page versions and use this data to optimize your funnel.

### **What are some good usage cases for this feature?**

Here are a few practical examples of using split testing in various industries and scenarios within funnels and websites:

**Online course sales funnel:**

An online course provider can conduct a split test on the landing page of their sales funnel by testing different headlines, course images, or call-to-action buttons. This can help identify which version of the landing page leads to higher conversions and more course enrollments.

For example, a language learning platform can test two headlines for its landing page: "Learn Spanish in Just 30 Days" and "Unlock the Secrets to Mastering Spanish Fast." They can also test two course images, one featuring a smiling student and another with an engaging course screenshot. The version with the highest conversion rate can be implemented in the sales funnel to attract more students.

**Webinar registration funnel:**

A business hosting a webinar can create a split test on its webinar registration page to optimize the registration process and increase the sign-up rate. They can test different headlines, registration form designs, or promotional images.

For example, a marketing agency hosting a webinar on SEO strategies can test two headlines for their registration page: "Discover the Top SEO Strategies for 2023" and "Boost Your Website Traffic with Proven SEO Techniques." They can also test two different registration form designs, one with a minimalistic look and another with a more visually engaging layout. The version with the highest registration rate can be used in the funnel to attract more attendees.

**E-commerce website checkout funnel:**

An e-commerce website can conduct a split test on the checkout pages within its sales funnel by testing different page layouts, button colors, or trust badges. This can help identify which version of the checkout page leads to higher conversions and reduced cart abandonment.

For example, an online clothing store can test two different layouts for their checkout page - one with a single page and another with a multi-step checkout process. They can also test different button colors, such as red or blue, to determine which color results in more completed purchases. The winning version can be implemented in the checkout funnel to optimize the shopping experience and increase sales.

**Lead magnet funnel:**

A business can test different lead magnet designs, headlines, or opt-in forms within their lead generation funnel to optimize the process and increase the conversion rate.

For example, a digital marketing agency offering a free SEO audit can test two lead magnet designs, one featuring an attractive cover image and another with a compelling headline. They can also test two different opt-in form designs, one with fewer input fields and another with more detailed questions. Analyzing the results, they can optimize their lead magnet funnel for better engagement and higher lead generation.

### **Benefits of Split Testing**

The benefits of split testing in funnels and websites are numerous and can significantly improve your marketing efforts and overall business performance. Here are some of the key benefits:

**Improved conversion rates:  **By testing different variations of your funnel or website elements, you can identify the most effective version, leading to higher conversion rates, whether signing up for a newsletter, purchasing a product, or completing any other desired action.

**Enhanced user experience:  **Split testing helps you understand what your target audience prefers and what resonates with them. By implementing the winning variation, you can create a better user experience that meets your audience's needs and expectations.

**Informed decision-making:** Split testing provides data-driven insights, allowing you to make informed decisions about your marketing strategies and website design. This helps you avoid relying on assumptions or personal preferences, leading to more effective marketing campaigns and website improvements.

**Reduced bounce rates:** By identifying and implementing the best-performing variations, you can create web pages and funnel steps that are more engaging and relevant to your audience, resulting in lower bounce rates.

**Increased return on investment (ROI):** Optimizing your funnels and websites through split testing can lead to higher conversion rates and improved user experience, ultimately increasing your ROI for marketing campaigns, website development, and overall business efforts.

**Continuous improvement:** Split testing encourages a culture of continuous improvement, as you can always test new ideas, designs, and strategies to refine your funnels and websites, ensuring that they remain effective and aligned with your audience's preferences.

**Cost-effective optimization:** Split testing allows you to compare different variations simultaneously, finding the best-performing version more quickly and cost-effectively than making random changes and hoping for the best.

**Competitive advantage:** Regularly conducting split tests and implementing the winning variations can give you a competitive edge, as you'll be able to adapt and optimize your marketing strategies and website design to meet your audience's needs and preferences better.

## **How to create a split test?**

**Please Note**

    Split testing will only be possible once you have added a domain to your funnel.

* * *

First, Navigate to**  Sites> Funnels (or Websites) > **Go to the Funnel (or Website) that you want to do a split test with.  
  
Choose the desired **Funnel Step in  **which you want to create a split test. Click on **Create Variation.**  

**Please Note**

    making noticeable changes to the Variation helps to make the Split Test more productive. If barely noticeable differences exist between the Control and the Variation then the Split test will not be an accurate representation of which step is better.
    
    Please avoid making changes to the Control while the Split test is running so you can get a more accurate picture of which variant is better.

Once you have chosen one of the three options, you can move a **Slider** to decide what percentage of traffic you want to divert to the **Control Page** and what percentage to the **Variation.  **Once that is decided, you can click **Start Split Test.**

It will then ask you for confirmation about the changes that have been made. Click on **Apply** to proceed.  

**Please Note**

    Even though all the traffic is brought to your page's URL, it is then split as per the Split Test Slider towards the dedicated URLs for the **Control Page** and the **Variation Page**. You can edit the dedicated URLs for the Control and the variation by clicking on the **Gear Icon** below them.

    **Gear Icon below the Control Page lets you edit its dedicated URL Path.**
    
    **The Gear Icon below the Variation lets you edit its dedicated URL  Path.**

Split tests work via browser cookies, so once you open the main URL, a cookie will be attached to you for whichever variant appears. If you (while doing a test for yourself) would like to see the other Variation, open the URL again in an incognito tab or another browser altogether.

## **Split Test Results**

As traffic begins to flow to the Page, the result of the Split Test will begin to populate between the two variants.

****You can view detailed Stats for the Split Test by clicking on the**Stats** tab above the Page and then clicking on the Page you are running the Split Test on to expand a dropdown of stats on the **Control  **and the **Variation.**

## **FAQ**

### **Q1. All the traffic goes only  ****to****  the control page, and nothing goes to the variation page.**

Please ensure that the domain advertised on your ads is the same as for the funnel step for which you run the Split Test.  

If people are being routed to your root domain (or subdomain) and not visiting your Split Testing page's domain, then the Split Test will not work. An easy way to ensure this would be to make your root domain's default page be marked as the Page you are running the Split test on.

### **Q2. The stats do not match the ratio configured for split testing.**

One of the links - either the direct link to the control page or the variation page - may be used on a page on another funnel or an ad that skips split testing logic. Making some percentage of visitors be routed to that other Page. So the numbers will look skewed.

### **Q3. Google Ads/FB Ads policies conflict with Path URL redirection. This happens in Split tests; how do I work around this?**

At times, Google Ads and Facebook Ads policies do not permit the use of path URL redirection in split tests. In this situation, a workaround is to conduct the split test on the second step of your sales funnel instead.

You can direct leads from your Google and Facebook Ads to the first step of the funnel, which can contain educational material to engage the lead and keep them interested until they take the next step in the funnel. By doing this, you can avoid breaking any ad redirect policies.

In essence, you are separating the split test from the lead acquisition process, allowing you to gather data on which ad version performs better without violating policies. This workaround enables you to run split tests compliantly and gather valuable insights for optimizing your ad campaigns.
