# **Re-billing the costs to your clients and making a profit**

(only for 497 SaaS Agencies)

Once you have enabled Premium Actions in your agency account, it will be automatically enabled for all your clients to use. 

You can bill your clients at cost or add an additional markup.

## **How to turn on re-billing for my clients?**

  1. Ensure you have enabled **LC Premium Triggers and Actions** for your Agency first. ([see instructions](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001231559-how-to-enable-lc-premium-triggers-actions-for-workflows#:~:text=head%20into%20your%20AgencyLevel%20%3E%20Settings%20%3E%20Company%20%3E%20LC%20%2D%20Premium%20Triggers%20%26%20Actions%20and%20enable%20the%20toggle.))  

  2. If the sub-account isn't in SaaS Mode already, switch the sub-account into SaaS Mode by going into your **Agency account** > **Accounts tab  **> **Scroll to the sub-account** > Click the **three dots icon** and select "**Switch to SaaS.** "  [How to convert a location to SaaS](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001184920).  

  3. In **Agency account** > **Accounts tab** > Scroll to the **Sub-Account** > Click the **View Details  **link > Scroll to the LC - Premium Triggers & Actions for Workflow Re-Sell Settings section and toggle it on.  

  4. Use the slider to set the amount of markup you like to make and hit save!  

  5. Rinse and repeat for all your Sub-Accounts where you wish to rebill for usage.

* * *

## **Some Examples of Re-billing**

LC Premium Triggers and Actions **_are disabled below,_** meaning the Agency will pay for executions consumed after the complimentary 100 executions are used up. 

[](https://emojipedia.org/index-pointing-up/)

The re-billing is turned on in this case, but there is **_no markup_**. So while the agency can pass on the costs to their clients, they are not making any profit (margins).

###   

The re-billing is turned on in this case, and there is a 5x markup. This means the agency has a 500% margin and earns $4 for every $1 their clients spend.

###

# **How does re-billing work?**

  * Agencies pay HighLevel and get invoices with high-level branding
  * Sub-accounts (your clients) pay you (the agency) and get invoices with your branding. The money is deposited in your Stripe account connected to your agency level. [How do I connect my agency's Stripe account to collect payments from my clients? ](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001171910)

This is very similar to other products that use re-billing or reselling models in the platform. Just like LC Phone or LC Email re-billing, re-billing of the Premium Workflow actions also utilizes "credits" from the agency wallet & the location wallet, respectively.
