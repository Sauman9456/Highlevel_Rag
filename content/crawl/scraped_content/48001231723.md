Modified on: Mon, 20 May, 2024 at 2:41 PM

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It's an easy way for you to keep up with news and information that's important to you, and helps you avoid the conventional methods of browsing or searching for information on websites. 

RSS Link for blogs can be used to send newsletters using Email Campaign or scheduling post automation using RSS function in Social Planner. 

Prerequisite - Domain needs to be associated 

How does it work?

  1. Go to Sites > Blogs
  2. In Blogs, there is option of "Settings" with gear icon beside the New Blog Option

  * 

  1. Go the RSS option

  1. Select the Blog option from the dropdown
  2. Enter the number of posts to be present in the RSS link

Note - maximum can be 100 posts

  1. Copy the URL and you can use it anywhere in Emails RSS Campaign or Social posting with RSS

Note - If you change the option in dropdown in RSS, it doesn't affect the other RSS url which you copied and used, it will keep working.
