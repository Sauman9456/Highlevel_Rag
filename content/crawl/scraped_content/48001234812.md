## **How to access previous records of generated Content AI?**

## **What is the benefit of having a log of previously generated Content AI?**

Having access to a log of generated content can be very helpful for businesses to keep track of their content creation and ensure consistency across their brand messaging. Accessing previous logs of generated content can also save time for businesses, as they can reuse content that has already been generated and make any necessary tweaks or adjustments as needed.
