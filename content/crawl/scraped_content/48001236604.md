## **Eliza Dashboard Overview**  

##   

### **Admin View of users**

On the right side of the dashboard, Admin users can see the list of agents, their online status, and the number of conversations open with each one.

### **Unassigned Conversations**

You need to pay particular attention to Unassigned conversations as they are not in anybody's inbox and are unattended. So an admin or an agent can transfer these unassigned conversations to any agent assigned to work on that location by clicking the "Go" button. 

### **Assigning conversations**

To transfer the conversations from the unassigned state to any agent or from one agent to the other, click on the Go button and choose from-agent (or unassigned) the count of conversations that need to be transferred to the To-agent. 

Clicking Assign will transfer the ownership.
