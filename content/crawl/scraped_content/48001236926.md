## **What is the Invoice Notification Customization feature?**

The new feature allows businesses to customize email and SMS notifications for invoicing differently. Firstly, companies can create templates for invoicing notifications, giving them greater control over the look and feel of their notifications. Companies can customize the font, colors, and overall design to match their branding.

Secondly, businesses can include specific invoice details in their notifications. For example, companies can include the customer's name and address, the invoice total, the due date, and the invoice URL. This can help customers quickly and easily understand what they owe and when it is due, reducing the number of follow-up emails or calls.

Finally, customization can be done for the customer receiving the invoice and for the sub-account user sending the invoice. This means businesses can create different templates and notifications for other customers or sub-account users, which can be helpful for interactions with multiple customers or sub-account users.

### **Who is this feature built for?**

This feature is helpful for businesses that use invoicing to manage their financial transactions. Specifically, it benefits companies that want to control the look and feel of their invoicing notifications and customize them to match their branding.
