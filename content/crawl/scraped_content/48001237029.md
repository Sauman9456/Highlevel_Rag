Modified on: Sun, 9 Apr, 2023 at 12:09 PM

The "Multiple Emails for a Contact" feature allows users to add more than one email address to a contact's details: one primary Email Address and Ten Additional Email addresses. Users can add, manage, and edit multiple email addresses for a contact and choose a primary email that will be used for all actions and interactions with the contact. Additionally, the feature will support conversation for additional emails, bulk import, and emails in the near future.

## **What are the Additional Emails for a Contact feature?**

The "Multiple Emails for a Contact" feature is a new functionality that allows users to add multiple email addresses to a contact's profile. This feature is designed to enhance the functionality of contact management by providing more flexibility in how email information is stored and managed.

**Please Note:**

    Apart from the original primary Email Address, users may add up to **Ten  **additional email addresses. Which is a total of Eleven Email addresses, any one of which can be toggled to be made the primary Email Address at any point.

Once enabled, users can add, edit, and manage multiple email addresses for a contact. This can be done while creating a new contact or editing an existing one. Users can specify which email address is the primary one that will be used for all communications and interactions with that contact. This can be helpful in cases where a contact has multiple email addresses for different purposes, such as work and personal email addresses.

In addition to the current functionality, future updates to the feature are planned to include conversation support for additional emails, bulk import of email information, and additional email management features. These updates will make it even easier for users to manage email information for their contacts while providing more communication and outreach options.

### **What are the benefits of this feature?**

This can be particularly useful for contacts with multiple email addresses for different purposes or roles.

**Improved Communication:  **Users can choose a primary email address for each contact, which will be used for all actions and interactions with that contact. This helps to ensure that communication is directed to the correct email address, making it easier to stay in touch with contacts and avoid missing important messages.

**Time-Saving:** The ability to bulk import email information can save time, particularly for users who must add multiple email addresses for many contacts.

**Increased Efficiency:  **With the ability to manage multiple email addresses for each contact, users can avoid creating multiple contacts for the same person with different email addresses. This can help avoid duplication and confusion, and increase efficiency and productivity.

By having multiple email addresses for each contact, organizations can ensure that their communication reaches the right person and is tailored to their interests.
