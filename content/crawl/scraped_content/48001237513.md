Check out [How to Migrate My Agency Over to LC - Email](https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001222501)

Check out [How to move a sending domain from Mailgun to LeadConnector?](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001226115-how-to-set-up-a-dedicated-sending-domain-lc-email-#How-to-move-sending-domain-from-Mailgun-to-LeadConnector?)

Main Domain:

  * If you are adding the main Domain,[ it should not be used with Gsuite or any other email provider](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203357040-Can-I-Use-the-Same-Domain-Name-for-Mailgun-and-for-Google-Apps-Or-Another-Email-Server-) 

Sub-domain:

  * To set up the subdomain, you can type ANYTHING_HERE.companyname.com
    * Examples:
      * replies.companyname.com
      * support.companyname.com

3\. Click on Add & Verify

The next screen that you're taken to will ask you to add DNS records to your Domain. Leave this screen open for the next step.

4\. Now log in to your DNS records based on where you get the Domain and add the 5 DNS records.

## To add the 1st TXT record

Sign in to your [GoDaddy Domain Portfolio](https://dcc.godaddy.com/control/portfolio) to add your [first TXT record](https://ca.godaddy.com/help/add-a-txt-record-19232). 

Click on the three dots for the Domain Edit Options next to your Domain

Select **Edit DNS**. You may need to scroll down to see the Edit DNS option.

Click on Add to add a new record.

B. Host: DO NOT INCLUDE THE ROOT DOMAIN

  * Depending on the subdomain you are trying to set up, if you are trying to set up
    * **lc**.companyname.com - The host name will be **lc**  
    * [replies.companyname.com](//replies.companyname.com) \- The host name will be **replies**
  * If you are setting up a **main** domain like companyname.com, the hostname will be **@**

Example 1 using subdomain:  
Copy **mx._domainkey.helpdesk** as the hostname|   
---|---  
Example 2 using main Domain:  
Copy **mailo._domainkey**  as the hostname|   

C. TXT Value:

Suppose you have a Gsuite account to capture incoming emails for the main Domain. Make sure you are using a subdomain.

If you are setting up a **main** domain like companyname.com, the host name will be **@**

C. Points to: Same for everyone

    paste the following data **[mxa.mailgun.org](//mxa.mailgun.org) **

D. Priority is **10** which is also same for everyone no matter what Domain you are trying to set

        paste the following data **[mailgun.org](//mailgun.org)**

****  

D. Click on**Save**

Now that you have added 5 records, click on **Verify Domain**
