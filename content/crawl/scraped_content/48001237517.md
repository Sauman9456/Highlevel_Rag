### **What are the functionalities of this role?**

The functionalities of the Agency Owner role include:

  * Serving as the primary User for an agency account, making them the main point of contact for critical communications and actions.
  * Retaining the same permissions as an Agency Admin, ensuring they can manage and oversee all aspects of the agency account.
  * Possessing the exclusive ability to transfer ownership to another user with an Agency Admin role provides account management flexibility.
  * Preventing other Agency Admins from changing the Agency Owner's role or deleting their account without transferring ownership ensures account leadership stability.
  * Collaborating with other users in the agency account to make crucial decisions and manage the team effectively.

  * **Enhanced Control:** The Agency Owner can transfer ownership, offering better control over agency account management and facilitating smooth transitions when needed.
  * **Stability and Security:** Preventing unauthorized role changes or account deletions ensures that the Agency Owner maintains stability in the account leadership, contributing to a secure and well-managed agency environment.
  * **Improved Collaboration:** The Agency Owner role fosters better collaboration between team members, as they have a clear leader to turn to for guidance, support, and decision-making. This can result in a more cohesive and productive team dynamic.
