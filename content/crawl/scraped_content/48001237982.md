## **Usage**

  * Format the Inbound Webhook Trigger data to Set Event Start Date, to update Contact Custom Fields, to compare in If/Else Condition.
  * Let's say the date format is MM/DD/YYYY, but you need to send it to an app that formats dates as DD/MM/YYYY. You can use the Date/Time Formater to change the date format and send it via Custom Webhook.
  * Store the custom formatted date time info in Google Sheets
  * Use the custom formatted date time info in Email/SMS/Slack
  * Compare the Current date(Start Date) with the Invoice Due date(End Date) and use the dynamic value in Email/SMS/Slack,  
Eg: Your Invoice is due in {{datetime_formatter.1.days}} days,  
  
**Please Note:**

    On overdue, that is when Current Date(Start Date) is greater than the Invoice Due Date(End Date) you will get the result in a negative value
