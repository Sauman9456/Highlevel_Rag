This allows you to select the specific Worksheet to which you want to send data.

#### **Selecting Starting Column and End Column in the Worksheet**

When sending data to a Google Sheets document using our workflow system, the sheet's first row is automatically considered the header row, and each Column is labeled based on the header values in that row.

If you need to update the headers in the sheet, you can click the "Refresh Headers" button to fetch the latest header values from the sheet. This ensures that your data is correctly mapped to the correct columns in the sheet and that your workflow is up-to-date with the latest sheet configurations. 

By providing this functionality, our system makes it easy to automate data management processes and ensure the accuracy of your data workflows.

#### **Insert values to create a new row in the Worksheet:**

You can insert value and create a new row in your Google Sheets document.

* * *

### **Update Specific Spreadsheet Row  
**

#### **Choose a worksheet:**

Specify the row number that you wish to modify in the Spreadsheet.

You may also provide the Row Number using the Custom Variable Picker to use dynamic values.

You can leave it blank if you do not wish to update a particular column.

* * *

### **Delete Specific Spreadsheet Row**

The "Delete Specific Spreadsheet Row" action enables us to delete the contents of a specific row by specifying its row number. This action will clear the values in all of the columns of that row.

**Please Note:**

     When you use the "Delete Specific Spreadsheet" action, it clears the contents of the row, but it does not permanently remove the row itself.

#### **Insert Row Number:**

### **  Lookup Spreadsheet Row**

The Google Sheet Lookup action allows you to look up data within your Google Sheets documents, providing you with a powerful tool for managing your data workflows.

  * Using our system, you can easily Lookup any row in your sheet and use the custom values associated with that row within your workflow.
  * This functionality allows you to automate complex data management processes, such as cross-referencing data from multiple sheets or databases.

#### **Choose a worksheet:**

Select a worksheet within your Spreadsheet that you wish to use for Looking up and retrieving data.

Select in which order the Google Sheet rows should be searched to find the matching row.

From the top of the Sheet - returns the first matching row

From the bottom of the Sheet - returns the most recent matching row

#### **Select a Column and Lookup Value to find the matching row**

The first row is considered Headers, shown as labels for each Column. You can fetch the latest headers from the sheet by clicking "Refresh Headers".columncolumn

#### **Select an extra Column and Lookup Value.**

If an extra column is added, then both the Column's values should match to determine the matching row.

#### **Create Spreadsheet row if it doesn't exist yet:**

#### If enabled, it will execute Create Spreadsheet Row action when the lookup could not find any matching row at the time of execution. This action will be logged and charged separately.  

### **Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s)**

Lookup Multiple Spreadsheet Row(s) is an extension to the Lookup Spreadsheet Row. Using this we can extract multiple rows. The configuration will be the same as Look Spreadsheet Row just with an addition of selecting the number of rows you want to extract.

The only difference is selecting the number of rows and that can be achieved by typing in the number of Rows in the "Row Count" field.

#### **Using as Custom Variables:**

One of the advantages of using Lookup is that when you search for a particular row, all of its data can be saved as a custom value that can be utilized throughout your workflow.

Consider the following Worksheet as an example. If you need to search for a specific row, you can enter the contact phone number or email address in the lookup section. Once the lookup function finds the matching row, it will store all the values under the corresponding header name as custom variables.

#### ** **

When you add a Lookup action, an index is automatically generated. This index is essential for mapping the row data to the custom variables and allows for easy identification of multiple lookup values. Removing or editing the index once it is added is impossible.

The values obtained from the lookup action for a particular row can be used in all other activities within your workflows, just like any other contact fields or custom variables.

**Please Note:**

     As previously mentioned, the index generated by the lookup function serves as a reference and is used for internal mapping of the custom variables in lookup actions.

You can use {{sheet.x.rowNumber}} to get the row number of the lookup value.

Here x is the index of the lookup action.

**Example:**

The custom values of LookedUp Row can be utilized in all of the actions within your workflow. Some examples of how to do this are provided below.

**In If/Else:**

#### **Important points to remember:**

  * Referencing the Google Sheets Lookup Action cannot find a matching row; all subsequent Google Sheets Actions that reference this Lookup Action will be skipped due to lack of a result. Therefore, consider this when building workflows that include this Lookup Action and the Google Sheets: Update Spreadsheet Row using Lookup or Google Sheets: Delete Spreadsheet Row using Lookup.
  * Provide
  * since the Lookup Action results are available for If/Else Conditions, you can use those to decide whether to use Google Sheets: Create Spreadsheet Row or Google Sheets: Update Spreadsheet Row using Lookup, based on the condition of having a Lookup Result or not. use
