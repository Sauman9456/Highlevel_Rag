## **How to use the Custom Webhook LC Premium Workflow Action?**

### **Fill Url:  **

You have the ability to send data requests to any URL of your choice without the need for coding or server operation.

### **Select a Method**

You can choose any HTTP method that suits your needs, such as POST, GET, DELETE, or PUT.

### **Select Authorization Method**

We support various types of authorization methods, allowing you to choose the one that suits your needs when accessing the webhook. 

### **Headers & Query Parameters:**

In addition to sending a request body, our system allows you to include headers and query parameters when sending requests to a webhook.

Headers can be used to provide additional information about the request, such as authentication credentials, content type, and cache control. 

Query parameters, conversely, can be used to pass parameters to the webhook endpoint, allowing you to filter or modify the response data you receive.

### **Configure the data to be sent in the Custom Webhook:**

The Custom Webhook premium feature allows you to map custom values in any structure that suits your requirements. Our user-friendly textbox provides autocomplete suggestions for all custom values, including inbound webhook variables.

This feature simplifies the mapping process and saves time by suggesting potential values that match your input. Additionally, it helps ensure accuracy and consistency in your data mapping.

### **Important points to be considered:**

  * Successful execution of the Custom Webhook Action depends on the successful response of the referenced API. Therefore, if errors are sent back, those will reflect on the Contact's Workflow execution and cause the action to be Failed (and then skipped) or Retry with exponential backoffs. 
  * In addition to what was stated above in #1, make sure that the receiving server can handle the number of Executions that you are targeting, or else you might end up with errors due to limits being reached for server issues. The Custom Webhook Action will get fired as soon as the Contact reaches the step, so make sure to add Contacts into the Workflow with the receiving server's limits in mind.
