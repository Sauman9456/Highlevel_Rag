### **Format Date**

The Format Date function is a crucial feature of the Date/Time Formatter action, specifically designed to convert date structures from one format to another. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the Format Date function:

#### **Field Selection:**

Choose the date field you want to reformat. You can select various sources such as a Specific Date, Current Date, Contact's date fields, date type custom fields, Appointment start/end date, Custom values, or even from an Inbound Webhook Trigger.

**Please Note:**

     Currently, Contact Custom fields do not support the Date Time structure.

#### **From Format:  **

If you select a system field like Specific Date, Current Date, Contact's date type standard or custom fields, or Appointment start/end date, the tool will auto-detect the format and preselect it. You must manually select the matching format if you choose a Custom Value or an Inbound Webhook Trigger.

#### **To Format:  **

Select the desired format for the output date from the list of available formats. This is the format the original date will be converted to.

#### **Output:  **

Once you've set up the Format Date function, you can use the result in subsequent actions within your workflow. The output can be accessed using the dynamic variable: {{datetime_formatter.1.date}}

### **Format Date/Time**

The Format Date and Time function is an essential feature of the Date/Time Formatter action, designed to convert date and time structures from one format to another. Here's a more detailed explanation of the Format Date and Time function:

#### **Field Selection:  **

Choose the date and time field you want to reformat. You can select various sources such as a Specific Date and Time, Current Date and Time, Appointment start/end date and time, Custom values, or even from an Inbound Webhook Trigger. Note that Contact Custom fields do not currently support Date Time structures.

**Please Note:**

     Currently, Contact Custom fields do not support the Date Time structure.

#### **From Format:**  

The tool will auto-detect the format and preselect if you select a system field like Specific Date and Time, Current Date and Time, or Appointment start/end date and time. You must manually select the matching format if you choose a Custom Value or an Inbound Webhook Trigger.

#### **To Format:  **

Select the desired output date and time format from the list of available formats. This is the format the original date and time will be converted to.

#### **Output:  **

Once you've set up the Format Date and Time function, you can use the result in subsequent actions within your workflow. The output can be accessed using the dynamic variable: {{datetime_formatter.1.datetime}}

### **Compare Dates**

The Compare Dates function is a valuable feature of the Date/Time Formatter action that allows users to compare two dates and obtain the difference in days. Here's a detailed overview of the Compare Dates function:

#### **Start Date Selection:  **

Choose the start date from various sources such as a Specific Date, Current Date, Contact's date fields, date type custom fields, Appointment start/end date, Custom values, or an Inbound Webhook Trigger.

#### **Start Date Format:  **

If you select a system field like Specific Date, Current Date, Contact's date type standard or custom fields, or Appointment start/end date, the tool will auto-detect the format and preselect it. You must manually select the matching format if you choose a Custom Value or an Inbound Webhook Trigger.

#### **End Date Selection:  **

Choose the end date from the same sources as the start date (Specific Date, Current Date, Contact's date fields, date type custom fields, Appointment start/end date, Custom values, or from an Inbound Webhook Trigger).

#### **End Date Format:  **

Like the start date format, the tool will auto-detect the format and preselect it if you choose a system field. You must manually select the matching format for Custom Value or Inbound Webhook Trigger.

#### **Output:**  

After setting up the Compare Dates function, you can use the result in subsequent actions within your workflow. The output, representing the difference in days, can be accessed using the dynamic variable: {{datetime_formatter.1.days}}

**Please Note:**

     The difference is calculated as End Date - Start Date. You will get a negative value if the Start Date exceeds the End Date.
    
    The Compare Dates function is beneficial for users who need to perform date comparisons for various purposes, such as calculating due dates, determining the duration between events, or making decisions based on the time difference between two dates.

* * *

### **Points to remember:**

  * Format the Inbound Webhook Trigger data to Set Event Start Date, to update Contact Custom Fields, and to compare in If/Else Condition.
  * Let's say the date format is MM/DD/YYYY, but you need to send it to an app that formats dates as DD/MM/YYYY; you can use the Date/Time Formater to change the date format and send it via Custom Webhook.
  * Store the custom formatted date time info in Google Sheets
  * Use the custom formatted date time info in Email/SMS/Slack
  * Compare the Current date(Start Date) with the Invoice Due date(End Date) and use the dynamic value in Email/SMS/Slack,
  * Eg: Your Invoice is due in {{datetime_formatter.1.days}} days,
  * Note: On overdue, that is when Current Date(Start Date) is greater than the Invoice Due Date(End Date), you will get the result in a negative value
