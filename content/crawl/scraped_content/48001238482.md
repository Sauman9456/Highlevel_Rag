## **What is the Export Contacts capability?**

This feature refers to exporting contacts from the CRM's contacts list. It allows users to select specific contacts, customize the relevant information columns, and download a .csv file.

## **How to export contacts?  **

**Please Note:**

     Only sub-account admins and location admins have the privilege to export contacts, ensuring secure access and control over sensitive contact information. This restriction helps maintain data integrity and prevents unauthorized usage of contact data.

### **Step 1: Access Contacts**

Log in to the account (as an Agency or Sub-Account admin)  

Navigate to the Contacts tab.

###   
**Step 2: Select Contacts**

Browse through your contacts list.

Check the box next to each contact you want to export  

**Please Note**

     You may also use filters to specify which contacts you want to mark for export

To select all contacts on a page or the entire list, use the corresponding checkboxes

**Please Note:**

     When exporting contacts, only the most recent note (up to 255 characters) is included for each contact. This keeps the exported .csv file size manageable and focuses on the latest information. In the .csv file, the newest note appears as a separate column, but older or longer notes are not included in the export.  

### **Step 3: Customize Columns (Optional)**

Click on the Columns button

Check or uncheck boxes to include or exclude specific columns in the export.

****

**Please Note**

     In the Contact Export section, if users have selected the email option in the smartlist column, a new column named “Additional Email” will automatically appear in the exported CSV file. This column will contain all the additional emails arranged in one column and separated by commas(,).

### **Step 4: Export Contacts**

Click the "Export Contacts" icon or button

Confirm your export action if prompted  

### **Step 5: Download the .csv File**

Wait for the export process to complete

Download the generated .csv file containing your selected contacts and their information.

Now you can use this .csv file for various purposes, such as transferring contacts to another account, importing them into a different system, or analyzing data.

## **FAQs**

### **Q1: Can I export only specific data fields for each contact in the exported .csv file?**

You can customize the columns in the exported .csv file by selecting or deselecting specific data fields before initiating the export. This way, you can focus on the most relevant information.

### **Q2: What happens if a contact's latest note exceeds 255 characters?**

Only the latest note of up to 255 characters is included when exporting contacts. If a contact's latest note is longer than this limit, it will be truncated to fit within the 255-character constraint.

### **Q3: Can I export contacts from multiple accounts or locations simultaneously?**

You must export contacts separately for each sub-account or location. However, you can combine the resulting .csv files in a spreadsheet application to consolidate contact data from multiple sources.

### **Q4: Is it possible to schedule automatic exports of contact data?**

This feature is not available at this time.

### **Q5: How do I import the exported .csv file into another contact management platform?**

Most contact management platforms provide an import feature that supports .csv files. You will need to follow the specific import instructions for the target platform, which typically involves mapping the columns in the .csv file to the appropriate fields in the new system.
