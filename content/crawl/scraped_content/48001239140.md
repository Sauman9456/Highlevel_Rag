# Where and how to configure the Missed Call Text Back feature

Modified on: Mon, 22 May, 2023 at 10:53 AM

Do you want to avoid missing important calls and potentially losing out on business opportunities? HighLevel offers a convenient missed-call-text-back feature to help you stay on top of your game. This feature can quickly be able and allows you to send a text to missed calls automatically. This will ensure you take advantage of every chance to connect with your prospects or clients when they need you most.

In this how-to guide, we'll take you through everything you need to know to set up and use the HighLevel missed-call-text-back feature, so you can streamline your communication and focus on growing your business. Let's get started!

**Please Note:**

    The _missed-call-text-back_ feature will trigger an SMS notification for every missed call, even if the caller tries multiple times within a brief timeframe.  
      
    To avoid receiving multiple SMS notifications for missed calls, it is suggested to [create and customize the exisiting recipe in workflows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvCPUxgMaM) and personalize it to manage according to your preference (Try adding a 20+/- min  wait step, or filter using tags - 1st call, 2nd call etc).
