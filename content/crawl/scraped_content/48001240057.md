## **_Things to Know Before Proceeding with Migration of WordPress Sites:_**

  1. **Zero Downtime:  **We value your business and understand how crucial it is for your websites to remain accessible at all times. Thus, we've designed this migration process to ensure zero downtime. Your websites will continue to function normally throughout the transition.
  2. **Temporary Restricted Access:  **To maintain data integrity and prevent any inadvertent issues, access to your GHL Dashboard will be temporarily restricted during migration. This means you won't be able to change your site for a brief period. We appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter. Rest assured, This is a temporary measure, and access will be restored immediately once the migration is completed.
  3. **Estimated Migration Time:** The migration process is swift and efficient. It is estimated to take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Our system will work behind the scenes to set up the necessary components and configurations to facilitate a seamless transition to the new infrastructure.
  4. **C****ontinued Support:  **Our dedicated customer support team will be available to help you with any questions or concerns during the migration process. You can reach out to us anytime, and we'll be more than happy to assist you.
  5. **Post-Migration Checks:  **Once the migration is complete, we recommend checking all your domains and sub-domains to ensure they function correctly. If you notice a "Not-Verified" tag next to any of them, there will be steps to follow for verification and proper functionality in the new infrastructure.

We appreciate your cooperation and understanding during this migration process. Our team is committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for you.

## **_Migration Steps:_**

1\. Go to your WordPress Dashboard. You will see a pop-up notification regarding the infrastructure update. Click on the 'Confirm Migration' button to proceed.

2\. After confirming the migration, our new infrastructure will create a WordPress instance specifically for your WordPress sites. This process typically takes around 10 minutes to complete. Our system will set up the necessary components and configurations during this time to ensure a seamless transition to the new infrastructure.

3\. Once the migration is complete, you will be automatically redirected to your dashboard, where all your domains and sub-domains are intact. If you notice a **"Not-Verified" tag** next to any of them, please follow these steps:

  * Click on the DNS Settings option for the respective domain.
  * You will be provided with DNS records that must be added to your DNS Provider.
  * Proceed to your DNS Provider's settings and add the DNS records as instructed.

By adding the DNS records correctly, you will ensure the proper verification and functionality of your domains and sub-domains in the new infrastructure.
