Hi Twilio Support, 

I would like to move the following phone numbers to a new sub-account - 

__**+1 PASTE_TWILIO_NUMBER_HERE**  __

Losing sub-account SID -  

please [contact HighLevel support](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001204857-ways-to-get-highlevel-support-24-) to get the ISV location's Twilio sub-account SID __**where the number is currently in**__** ** for you

Gaining sub-account SID -  

__**E.g. AC8a0eac4ea7651eba06137bbf1a907df62d < Replace your own Twilio sub-account SID here **__

Time-frame: ASAP 

Please process this request at the earliest because it is business-critical for me 

Thanks!
