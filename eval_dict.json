I was doing bunch of research on how to remediate it and came across couple helpful steps and one of them was:\\n\\ngetting \"A\" attestation for your phone number and the video mentioned talking to your phone provider ",
        "answer": "To remediate a phone number that is being marked as spam, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Register on Free Caller Registry**: This is a centralized platform where you can submit your phone number to be reconsidered by major U.S. carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. This can help in removing the 'spam likely' tag from your caller ID. You can register your phone number by visiting [Free Caller Registry](https://www.freecallerregistry.com/fcr/). This process is specifically for U.S. numbers. If the number is international, you may need to contact the terminating carrier directly.\n\n2. **SHAKEN/STIR Protocols**: Implementing SHAKEN/STIR protocols can help authenticate your caller ID information, which may boost answer rates due to the \"Trusted Call\" label. This involves using digital certificates to validate the caller's identity, ensuring that the call is coming from a legitimate source.\n\n3. **Contact Your Phone Provider**: For getting \"A\" attestation, you should contact your phone provider. They can assist in ensuring that your phone number is properly registered and verified, which can help in reducing the likelihood of your calls being marked as spam.\n\nThese steps can help improve your caller reputation and reduce the chances of your calls being flagged as spam.",

        "answer": "To provide Twilio to users after connecting to LeadConnector, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assign Twilio Numbers to Users:**\n   - Purchase a Twilio phone number and assign it to each user. Go to the location settings, click on 'Phone numbers', and add the number. Then, go to 'My Staff' under 'Team Management', edit the user, and assign the Twilio number to them. This ensures that all calls and SMS will be routed through the assigned Twilio number for that user.\n\n2. **User-Specific SMS Sending:**\n   - If a user is logged in and has a Twilio number assigned, the SMS will be sent from that specific Twilio number. If the Twilio number is SMS incapable, the default number will be used instead.\n\n3. **Default and Channel Numbers:**\n   - If the user does not have a Twilio number assigned, the system will use the channel number (the first Twilio number ever used with that contact) or the default outbound number.\n\n4. **Workflow Integration:**\n   - You can add a workflow action to assign contacts to users, ensuring that all communications are sent from the user's assigned Twilio number.\n\n5. **Managing Twilio Numbers:**\n   - Ensure that the Twilio numbers are properly configured and assigned to users to facilitate seamless communication. This setup allows users to manage their communications effectively using their assigned Twilio numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage and provide Twilio services to users within the LeadConnector system.",

A domain or subdomain should only have one DNS record set up for it to work correctly with a platform/server. \n   - Use a DNS lookup tool to verify where your domain is hosted and ensure DNS records are correctly set up and added to the correct domain host. \n   - If there is a \"CNAME / A record not found\" error, it indicates improper DNS setup or incorrect domain host configuration. \n\n2. **Verify Domain Setup:**\n   - If your domain shows a 404 error, ensure a default page is selected in the domain settings. If already selected, try saving it again. \n   - For intermittent 404 errors, ensure a redirect is set up from www to non-www (root) domain or vice versa.\n\n3. **SSL Issues:**\n   - SSL errors can occur due to multiple DNS records for the same domain/subdomain or missing DNS records. Ensure only one DNS record is set up for the domain/subdomain.\n   - If using Cloudflare, ensure the proxy status is set to \"DNS Only\" unless setting up a redirect.\n\n4. **Platform Compatibility:**\n   - A domain/subdomain can only be used with one platform/server at a time. If already in use with another platform (e.g., WordPress, Wix), use a different subdomain or domain.\n\n5. **Domain Removal:**\n   - To remove a domain, navigate to Settings > Domains, click on the three dots next to the domain, and select Delete.\n\nBy following these steps, you can troubleshoot and resolve common domain issues effectively.",

This is typically an endpoint URL provided by third-party systems like CRMs, email marketing tools, or other APIs.\n\n4. **Configure Payload:**\n   - Define the data that will be sent through the webhook using JSON format. You can use merge fields to dynamically pull in information like contact details, opportunity status, or custom fields.\n\n5. **Add Headers (Optional):**\n   - If the external system requires authentication or specific headers, you can add them here.\n\n6. **Test Webhook (Optional):**\n   - Before finalizing, you can use testing tools like Webhook.site or Postman to verify that the data is being sent correctly to the external system.\n\nRegarding the cost of using webhooks in HighLevel:\n- Agencies on any plan ($97, $970, $297, $2970, $497, $4970) can access LC Premium Triggers & Actions.\n- Once Premium Actions & Triggers are enabled via the Agency settings, existing and new sub-accounts will have 100 free executions.\n- For agencies to avoid accruing execution costs for existing sub-accounts, rebilling will need to be enabled manually for each sub-account within the Agency view.\n- If premium actions are enabled on the SaaS Configurator, new sub-accounts generated will automatically be enrolled in LC Premium Actions & Triggers, with no further action required by the agency.",

If the Nameservers are managed by a different provider, integrate the HighLevel records into the DNS of that provider. Use a tool like MX Toolbox to verify the hosting provider and that the records are propagating the correct data. \n\n2. **Check MX Records:**\n   - The MX record is essential for tracking replies. Use a tool like MX Toolbox to look up the MX record for your domain or subdomain. Ensure that the records point to the correct mail servers, such as mxa.mailgun.org and mxb.mailgun.org, if applicable. If other records point to different email servers, you may need to set up a subdomain for Mailgun or not use the domain for other email servers.\n\n3. **WIX Domain Provider Issues:**\n   - If you are using WIX as your domain provider, ensure that your nameservers are not managed by WIX. You may need to change the nameservers to another provider like GoDaddy. Follow the specific instructions for setting up DNS records with WIX to ensure proper email functionality.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to your domain provider's support team or HighLevel support for specialized help in resolving DNS-related issues.",

HighLevel monitors these rates to prevent spamming and phishing. If any thresholds are exceeded, SMS sending privileges are suspended temporarily. \n   - Error codes such as 30003 (Unreachable destination handset) or 30004 (Message blocked) can indicate issues like the recipient's number being unreachable or blocked.\n   - If a recipient has opted out by replying with keywords like STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, etc., you will not be able to send messages to them unless they opt back in by replying with START or YES.\n\n2. **Review Messaging Policy Compliance:**\n   - Ensure compliance with the LC - Phone Messaging Policy, which includes obtaining proper consent (opt-in) and providing opt-out options in your messages.\n   - Avoid sending messages to numbers that have been marked as Do Not Disturb (DND) or are incapable of receiving SMS, such as landlines.\n\n3. **Check for Technical Issues:**\n   - Verify if there are any technical issues at the Twilio or LC Phone layer, such as number validation problems or sub-account suspensions.\n   - Use Twilio's logs to check for specific error messages or codes that can provide more details on why messages are not being delivered.\n\n4. **Take Corrective Actions:**\n   - If you receive a violation email, stop all workflows and campaigns to contacts who have not explicitly opted in.\n   - Customize the opt-out language and sender ID to ensure compliance with messaging policies.\n   - Discuss with clients to avoid bulk communication or cold prospecting message campaigns until the issue is resolved.\n\n5. **Prevent Future Blockages:**\n   - Follow best practices for SMS deliverability, such as avoiding the use of public URL shorteners, ensuring proper registration of business profiles and campaigns, and adhering to the stated use case and applicable rules.\n   - Regularly monitor error and opt-out rates to keep them within acceptable thresholds.",

        "answer": "To address domain-related issues, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Domain DNS Integration:**\n   - Ensure that the domain DNS records are correctly added to the provider where the domain nameservers are pointing. If the nameservers are managed by a different provider, integrate the necessary records into the DNS of that provider. Use tools like MX Toolbox to verify the hosting provider and ensure that the records are propagating the correct data [1].\n\n2. **Add and Verify DNS Records:**\n   - Add your domain in the settings under Email Services > Dedicated Domain and IP. Verify the domain using either auto-configure DNS or manual setup. Ensure that all DNS records, including TXT, CNAME, and MX, are correctly configured [5].\n\n3. **Check MX Records:**\n   - Use tools like MX Toolbox to check if the MX records are correctly pointing to the intended mail servers. Ensure that there are no conflicting records if using services like Mailgun or Google Workspace [12].\n\n4. **Troubleshoot SSL Errors:**\n   - If there are SSL errors, ensure that there are no multiple DNS (A or CNAME) records for the same domain/subdomain. Verify that the SSL certificate is issued correctly by checking the domain settings and reissuing the certificate if necessary [13].\n\n5. **Resolve Fingerprint Issues in WordPress:**\n   - If using WordPress, ensure that the funnel domain is configured correctly with a different subdomain than the main WordPress site to avoid cross-domain issues. This is crucial for accessing cookies and ensuring proper functionality [14].",

        "answer": "A2P registration failures can occur due to several reasons, and understanding these can help in addressing them effectively:\n\n1. **Common Reasons for Failure**:\n   - **Opt-In Information Provided**: Ensure that the opt-in process is clear and compliant with regulations. This includes having a live site with a proper opt-in form that includes checkboxes for Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy.\n   - **Forbidden Use Cases**: Certain business categories, such as high-risk financial services, gambling, and illegal substances, are not allowed to register for A2P campaigns.\n   - **Inaccurate Company Information**: Ensure that the business information provided matches official records, such as the CP 575 EIN Confirmation Letter.\n   - **Broken/Inactive Links**: All links provided during registration must be active and lead to the correct pages.\n\n2. **Fixing Failed Registrations**:\n   - Review and correct any inaccurate information, especially regarding company details and opt-in processes.\n   - Ensure that all provided links are functional and lead to the correct opt-in forms or policy pages.\n   - Avoid using placeholders or examples in the registration forms; use actual business information.\n\n3. **Campaign Vetting Process**:\n   - New campaigns undergo a manual vetting process, and a $15.75 fee is charged for this. Ensure compliance with best practices to avoid rejection.\n   - If a campaign fails, the fee is non-refundable, but corrections can be made for resubmission.\n\n4. **Registration Process**:\n   - The registration process involves brand registration, campaign registration, and carrier propagation. Each step must be completed accurately to avoid delays or failures.\n\n5. **Prohibited Content and Use Cases**:\n   - Ensure that the messaging content does not fall under prohibited categories such as SHAFT (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco) or involve illegal activities.\n\nBy addressing these common issues and ensuring compliance with the guidelines, the chances of successful A2P registration can be significantly improved.",

        "answer": "If your client's account has been blocked for SMS, it could be due to several reasons related to high error rates, high opt-out rates, or violations of messaging policies. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Check Error and Opt-out Rates:**\n   - A high opt-out rate indicates that recipients are marking messages as spam or unsubscribing. A good opt-out rate is typically between 0-1%. If it hits 2%, the account may be locked for 24 hours.\n   - A high error rate suggests messages are being sent to invalid numbers or numbers that cannot receive SMS. A good error rate is between 0-6%. If it reaches 12%, the account may be locked for 24 hours.\n\n2. **Review Messaging Practices:**\n   - Ensure that all recipients have opted in to receive messages. Consent cannot be bought or sold.\n   - Include opt-out instructions in the initial message, such as \"Reply STOP to unsubscribe.\"\n   - Avoid sending messages to landlines or using public URL shorteners like Bitly.\n\n3. **Compliance with Messaging Policies:**\n   - Ensure that messages comply with the LC Phone Messaging Policy and do not fall under forbidden categories such as gambling, illegal substances, or \"S.H.A.F.T.\" (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco).\n\n4. **Temporary Suspension:**\n   - If the account is temporarily suspended, it will be lifted in 24 hours. However, ensure that the issues causing the suspension are addressed to prevent future occurrences.\n\n5. **Contact Support:**\n   - If the account remains blocked or if there are issues beyond the temporary suspension, contact support for assistance in resolving the issue and ensuring compliance with all necessary guidelines.",

        "answer": "1. **Identify the Cause of Suspension:**\n   - High bounce rates can lead to email suspension. If your bounce rate exceeds the industry threshold (below 5%), your account may be temporarily suspended. A good bounce rate is typically in the range of 0 - 3% [1].\n   - Error and opt-out rates are also monitored. A high error rate (above 12%) or opt-out rate (above 3%) can lead to account suspension [2].\n\n2. **Check for Compliance Issues:**\n   - Ensure that your email content complies with the email sending policy. Violations such as sending unsolicited emails or using misleading content can result in suspension [4].\n   - Verify that your email practices align with best practices, such as using a dedicated domain, validating email addresses, and including unsubscribe links [1].\n\n3. **Review Account Settings and Practices:**\n   - Check if your account has been flagged for high error rates or opt-out rates. These metrics are crucial for maintaining email sending privileges [5].\n   - Ensure that your email domain is properly configured with necessary DNS settings, such as DMARC, to avoid deliverability issues [6].\n\n4. **Contact Support:**\n   - Reach out to support to understand the specific reason for your account suspension and to discuss steps for reinstatement. Provide any necessary documentation or evidence of compliance with email policies [4].\n\n5. **Implement Corrective Measures:**\n   - Cleanse your email list to remove invalid or non-existent addresses to reduce bounce rates [1].\n   - Adjust your email content and sending practices to align with compliance guidelines and reduce the risk of future suspensions [2].",

        "answer": "To transition from Twilio to LC Phone in GoHighLevel (GHL) and use the WAV multi-dialer, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Benefits of LC Phone**:\n   - LC Phone eliminates the need for a third-party telephony provider like Twilio, offering better cost management with real-time billing and increased security. It also provides features like ramped usage, error rate monitoring, and maximum sending limits on sub-accounts [1, 5].\n\n2. **Pricing and Cost Comparison**:\n   - The pricing for LC Phone is the same as Twilio, with a 10% discount on select categories. This makes it cost-effective while maintaining the same pricing structure as Twilio [2, 14].\n\n3. **Migration Process**:\n   - Agencies can migrate to LC Phone by switching in the agency Phone System settings. Once switched, sub-accounts can be moved over individually or in bulk. For non-US/Canada sub-accounts, a regulatory bundle needs to be created [1].\n\n4. **Using LC Phone with WAV Multi-Dialer**:\n   - While specific details about integrating LC Phone with WAV multi-dialer are not provided, using LC Phone generally involves setting up the phone system within GHL and ensuring all sub-accounts are transitioned. This setup should facilitate the use of multi-dialer functionalities as LC Phone supports robust telephony features [11].\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Ensure all necessary regulatory and compliance requirements are met, especially if transitioning international numbers. Utilize the support resources provided by GHL for any specific integration needs with the WAV multi-dialer [1, 11].\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively transition from Twilio to LC Phone in GHL and utilize the WAV multi-dialer for your telephony needs.",

This is crucial for successful registration. If the CP 575 notice is misplaced, request a 147c letter from the IRS to verify the information.\n\n2. **Check for Common Errors:**\n   - Ensure that the business name does not include terms like \"LLC\" if it's not a sole proprietorship.\n   - Avoid using custom variables instead of actual names and company names.\n   - Ensure opt-out language is included in message templates.\n   - Avoid using the same email, phone, or address in more than 10 A2P sole prop registrations.\n   - Ensure the phone number used for OTP verification is not used more than three times across all A2P Brand registrations.\n\n3. **Review and Correct Registration Details:**\n   - Check if the registration details are accurate and complete, including the business address, contact information, and industry type.\n   - Ensure that the phone number is a US or Canadian mobile number capable of receiving SMS.\n\n4. **Address Trust Score Issues:**\n   - If you received a low Trust Score, ensure that the business address matches the official registered company address and that the EIN is valid.\n   - If the Trust Score is still low after corrections, contact support for further assistance.\n\n5. **Submit for Re-evaluation:**\n   - Once corrections are made, resubmit the registration for approval. If the registration fails again, contact support for an identity status appeal, which involves a request to update information with The Campaign Registry (TCR).\n\n6. **Alternative Options:**\n   - If resolving the registration issues is challenging, consider using Toll-Free numbers, which require registration but are free and less complicated than A2P 10DLC.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to address the issues causing the failed A2P registrations and successfully register the sub-accounts.",

        "query": "All my emails are going to spam. I believe I have the DMARC, DKIM, and other settings configured, but I am new to all this and not sure what to do. ",
        "answer": "To address the issue of your emails going to spam, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Domain Settings:**\n   - Ensure that your domain is properly verified. This includes setting up DMARC, DKIM, and SPF records correctly. You can use tools like [Dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/) to check if your DMARC record is valid. Make sure your DNS settings are configured correctly for your domain.\n\n2. **Check Email Authentication:**\n   - Confirm that your DMARC, DKIM, and SPF records are set up correctly. These records help authenticate your emails and improve deliverability. Ensure that your DMARC policy is not too strict initially (e.g., set to \"none\" instead of \"reject\") to avoid emails being blocked.\n\n3. **Use a Dedicated Sending Domain and IP:**\n   - If possible, set up a dedicated sending domain and IP address. This helps in building a good sender reputation and improves deliverability. Avoid using public domains like Gmail or Yahoo for sending bulk emails.\n\n4. **Review Email Content:**\n   - Avoid using spammy words or phrases in your email content. Ensure that your emails are not overly promotional and maintain a good text-to-image ratio.\n\n5. **Monitor Engagement and List Health:**\n   - Regularly clean your email list to remove inactive subscribers. High engagement rates (opens, clicks) signal to email providers that your content is valuable.\n\n6. **Check Reverse DNS (rDNS) Settings:**\n   - Configure reverse DNS to display your company name instead of a third-party service. This enhances your brand identity and reduces the likelihood of emails being marked as spam.\n\n7. **Gradual Warm-Up:**\n   - If you are using a new domain or IP, gradually increase your sending volume to build a positive reputation with mailbox providers.\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve your email deliverability and reduce the chances of your emails going to spam.",

This can be done by deleting the existing Google Calendar integration and then re-adding it. This process ensures that any expired tokens are refreshed and the connection is re-established. [2, 5]\n\n4. **Verify Sync Preferences:**\n   - Check the sync preferences in the calendar settings to ensure that events are being pushed to the Google Calendar. This includes verifying that the calendar is set as a linked calendar and that the sync preferences are configured for two-way sync if needed. [14]\n\nBy following these steps, the appointments should start appearing on the Google Calendar as expected.",

If the error is not helpful, open a support ticket with the SMTP provider for further assistance.

If it says delivered, check the spam folder or contact Mailgun support if the email provider is blocking the email. [11]\n\n4. **SMTP Limitations:**\n   - If using SMTP, note that it may not show delivered/bounced stats. Only Mailgun can provide full statistics. Consider switching to Mailgun for more accurate tracking. [14]\n\n5. **Review Email Statistics:**\n   - Ensure that the CNAME record is correctly set up for Mailgun to track open and click events. Double-check Mailgun webhooks to ensure they are configured correctly for your domain. [14]",

This involves connecting your Zoom account through the settings in your calendar application. For instance, in HighLevel, you can connect Zoom by navigating to Settings > Calendar > Connections, and then selecting Zoom to sign in and authorize access.\n\n2. **Meeting Location Configuration**: Ensure that Zoom is selected as the meeting location in your calendar settings. This is crucial because the system generates a unique Zoom link only when Zoom is set as the meeting location.\n\n3. **Calendar Type**: Verify that you are using a calendar type that supports dynamic Zoom links. Dynamic Zoom links are typically supported in Round Robin and Collective calendars.\n\n4. **Workflow Setup**: If you are using a workflow to send out appointment reminders, ensure that the workflow includes a step to wait for a minute to process the location value before sending out the email/SMS with the Zoom link.\n\n5. **Check for Errors**: If the link is still not being sent, check for any errors in the integration or workflow setup that might be preventing the link from being generated or sent.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of Zoom meeting links not being sent.",

This will allow the system to sync with your Google Calendar. [3]\n\n2. **Configure Calendar Settings:**\n   - Go to Calendars > Calendar Settings > Connections.\n   - Select your linked calendar where all new events created in the system will be added. This ensures that any new event created in the system will sync to your linked calendar, allowing you to view it directly on Google Calendar. [3, 4]\n\n3. **Set Conflict Calendars:**\n   - Add your Google Calendar as a conflict calendar. This means that events from your Google Calendar will be synced to the system, blocking your availability for the event's duration. Only events marked as 'BUSY' will block availability, while 'FREE' events will not. [4, 5]\n\n4. **Sync Preferences:**\n   - In the Advanced Settings, choose between \"One-way Sync\" or \"Two-way Sync\". One-way sync will sync events as blocked slots without creating contacts for guests, while two-way sync will create contacts and turn events into system appointments.

This can be due to invalid email addresses, high bounce rates, or issues with the SMTP configuration. [1, 8, 10]\n\n2. **Email Validation:**\n   - Enable email validation to ensure that emails are sent only to valid addresses. This can help reduce bounce rates and improve deliverability. [5]\n\n3. **Check SMTP Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that the sender email matches the SMTP email configured. Mismatched configurations can lead to delivery failures. [10]\n\n4. **Monitor Bounce Rates:**\n   - High bounce rates can lead to suspension of email sending capabilities. Ensure that the bounce rate is below the industry threshold (typically below 5%). [2]\n\n5. **Review Email Content and Settings:**\n   - Ensure that the email content complies with best practices and that all necessary settings, such as unsubscribe links, are correctly configured.

This is where you will add the necessary DNS records.\n\n3. **Add SPF Record**:\n   - **Type**: TXT\n   - **Name**: Typically, this is the root domain (e.g., `@` for main domain or `subdomain` for subdomains).\n   - **Value**: `v=spf1 include:mailgun.org ~all` (This example is for Mailgun; adjust according to your email service provider).\n\n4. **Add DKIM Record**:\n   - **Type**: TXT\n   - **Name**: This is usually a selector followed by `._domainkey` (e.g., `default._domainkey`). The selector is provided by your email service provider.\n   - **Value**: The DKIM public key provided by your email service provider.\n\n5. **Verify Records**: Use tools like [Dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/dkim-inspector/) to verify that your DKIM and SPF records are correctly set up.\n\n6. **Test Email Deliverability**: Send test emails to ensure that they are being delivered to the inbox and not marked as spam. Use email testing tools to analyze your email content and sender reputation.\n\n7. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly check your email deliverability metrics and adjust your DNS records if necessary to maintain a good sender reputation.\n\nThese steps will help ensure that your emails are authenticated properly, improving deliverability and reducing the chances of being marked as spam.",

        "answer": "To address the issue of hitting your send limit for emails, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Current Limitations:**\n   - The LC Email system has a ramp-up model that gradually increases the email sending limit over the first 8 days. On the 8th day, the limit is set to 15,000 emails per day for shared domains and 450,000 emails per day for dedicated domains. \n   - The daily counter resets at midnight UTC, and if the limit is reached before this time, the account is locked for the rest of the period. \n\n2. **Extend Sending Limit:**\n   - If you are using a shared domain and need to send more than 15,000 emails per day, you will need to set up a dedicated sending domain for the sub-account.\n   - For dedicated domains, if you need to exceed the 450,000 emails per day limit, you should contact the support team to discuss increasing this limit.\n\n3. **Monitor and Adjust Usage:**\n   - Regularly monitor your email sending activity to ensure you are within the limits and adjust your campaigns accordingly.\n   - Consider spreading out your email campaigns over multiple days if you are consistently hitting the limit.\n\nBy following these steps, you can manage your email sending limits more effectively and ensure that your emails are sent as planned.",
