I was doing bunch of research on how to remediate it and came across couple helpful steps and one of them was:\\n\\ngetting \"A\" attestation for your phone number and the video mentioned talking to your phone provider ",
        "answer": "To remediate a phone number that is being marked as spam, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Register on Free Caller Registry**: This is a centralized procedure that allows entities to submit their data to the three major U.S. wireless carriers' service providers. By registering your phone number on the [Free Caller Registry](https://www.freecallerregistry.com/fcr/), you can potentially remove the 'spam likely' label from your number. This process is specifically for U.S. phone numbers. If the number is critical and cannot be replaced, this registration is recommended. Within three to five days of submission, you should receive confirmation emails from the providers responsible for updating all U.S.-based carriers.\n\n2. **Contact Your Phone Provider**: If the phone number is still marked as spam after registration, you may need to contact your phone provider. They can assist in getting \"A\" attestation for your phone number, which can help improve its reputation and reduce the likelihood of it being marked as spam.\n\n3. **Consider Replacing the Number**: If the phone number is relatively new or not critical to your business, it might be easier to replace it with a new one rather than trying to remediate the spam label.\n\nThese steps should help in addressing the issue of a phone number being marked as spam. If further assistance is needed, contacting the phone provider directly can provide additional support.",

TCR often rejects a campaign based on the first issue they encounter, so it's important to review the entire campaign submission and the client\u2019s website to ensure everything is correct and compliant.\n\n2. **Common Rejection Reasons and Solutions**:\n   - **Opt-In Information**: Ensure that the opt-in message workflow meets the requirements for the specific campaign type. Provide necessary links and documentation, include a privacy policy and terms of service, and avoid sharing opt-in information with unauthorized third parties.\n   - **Unverifiable Website**: Verify that the provided website(s) are functioning correctly and accessible. If the registration is for a pre-launch website, include a publicly accessible URL to view a screenshot of the SMS opt-in flow.\n   - **Incorrect Sole Prop Brand Registration**: Verify the accuracy and completeness of the registration information for the Sole Proprietorship Brand. Ensure that the brand meets the criteria defined by TCR and mobile carriers for Sole Proprietor (EIN) registration.\n   - **Inconsistencies Between Sample Message and Use-Case**: Ensure that the sample messages are accurate, detailed, and reflective of the actual messages to be sent under the campaign. Indicate templated fields within sample messages using brackets.\n\n3. **Review and Resubmit**: Once you have made the necessary changes to address the issue, resubmit the campaign for review.\n\n4. **Contact Support**: If the campaign cannot be approved due to an unknown error, contact Customer Support for assistance in understanding the underlying problem and finding a resolution.",

This is typically an endpoint URL provided by third-party systems like CRMs, email marketing tools, or other APIs.\n\n4. **Configure Payload:**\n   - Define the data that will be sent through the webhook using JSON format. You can use merge fields to dynamically pull in information like contact details, opportunity status, or custom fields.\n\n5. **Add Headers (Optional):**\n   - If the external system requires authentication or specific headers, you can add them here.\n\n6. **Test Webhook (Optional):**\n   - Before finalizing, you can use testing tools like Webhook.site or Postman to verify that the data is being sent correctly to the external system.\n\nRegarding the cost, agencies on any plan ($97, $970, $297, $2970, $497, $4970) can access LC Premium Triggers & Actions. Once Premium Actions & Triggers are enabled via the Agency settings, existing and new sub-accounts will have 100 free executions. For agencies to avoid accruing execution costs for existing sub-accounts, rebilling will need to be enabled manually for each sub-account within the Agency view.

If other records point to different email servers, you may need to set up a subdomain for Mailgun or not use the domain for other email servers.\n\n3. **Check Email Deliverability Settings:**\n   - Ensure that your dedicated sending domain is set up correctly. This includes verifying that all DNS records are correctly configured and that the domain is verified. If you are using LC Email, make sure the dedicated domain is active and properly configured.\n\n4. **Troubleshoot Common Issues:**\n   - If emails are not being sent, check if there are any issues with the email service provider or if there are any server downtimes.

Ensure these rates are within acceptable thresholds to avoid future suspensions.\n\n5. **Wait for Suspension to Lift**: The sub-account suspension will typically be lifted in 24 hours. However, if the sub-account is permanently suspended, refer to the article on why the account is suspended for further steps to unsuspend the sub-account.\n\n6. **Allowed Actions During Suspension**: Note that one-on-one conversations, test SMS, resend messages, and MissedCallTextBack are allowed even if the account is suspended.",

        "answer": "1. **Transition from Twilio to LC Phone in GHL:**\n   - Agencies can migrate their existing sub-accounts to LC Phone by following a structured process. This involves validating LC Phone System access, converting the agency to ISV, and moving existing sub-accounts over to LC Phone. The migration process can be done in bulk for US/Canada sub-accounts or individually for non-US/Canada sub-accounts, which requires creating a Regulatory Bundle.\n   - The costs of using LC Phone are similar to Twilio, with a 10% discount on select categories. Agencies will be billed through the agency billing tab, and detailed transaction logs can be downloaded for analysis.\n   - If a client switches from Twilio to LC, call recordings will not transfer over but will remain available in the customer\u2019s Twilio account.\n   - For moving numbers from Twilio to LC Phone, agencies need to provide the location ID to support and create a support ticket with Twilio, including necessary details like losing and gaining sub-account SIDs.\n\n2. **WAV Multi-Dialer:**\n   - There is no specific information available regarding the WAV multi-dialer in the provided documents. However, if it involves telephony services, similar processes and considerations as those for LC Phone might apply, such as number migration and integration with existing systems.",

        "answer": "To address the issue of your emails going to spam, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check DMARC, DKIM, and SPF Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that your DMARC, DKIM, and SPF records are correctly set up. These are crucial for email authentication and help prevent your emails from being marked as spam. You can use tools like [Dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/) to verify your DMARC setup.\n\n2. **Review Your Email Content:**\n   - Avoid using spammy words or phrases in your email content. Ensure that your emails are not overly promotional and maintain a good text-to-image ratio. Avoid using URL shorteners as they can trigger spam filters.\n\n3. **Domain and IP Reputation:**\n   - Check your domain and IP reputation. If your domain or IP has a poor reputation, it can lead to emails being marked as spam. Consider warming up your domain if it's new, as it can take up to four weeks for a domain to be fully warmed up.\n\n4. **Use a Dedicated Sending Domain and IP:**\n   - If possible, set up a dedicated sending domain and IP address. This helps in building a good reputation and improves deliverability.\n\n5. **Monitor Engagement Metrics:**\n   - Keep track of engagement metrics like open rates and click-through rates. High engagement can improve your sender reputation.\n\n6. **Check Email Health Reports:**\n   - Use tools like [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/emailhealth) to review your email health report. This can help identify any issues with your domain that might be affecting deliverability.\n\n7. **Ensure Proper \"From Email\" Setup:**\n   - Make sure your \"From Email\" matches your sending domain to avoid deliverability issues.\n\n8. **Avoid Sending from Public Domains:**\n   - Sending emails from public domains like gmail.com or yahoo.com can lead to them being marked as spam. Use a domain that you own.\n\n9. **Check for Blacklisting:**\n   - Ensure that your domain or IP is not blacklisted. If it is, follow the necessary steps to get it removed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve your email deliverability and reduce the chances of your emails going to spam.",

        "answer": "1. **Check Calendar Configuration:** Ensure that the calendar is properly configured under Calendars > Calendar Settings > Connections. Verify that the Linked Calendar and Conflict Calendars are set correctly. This ensures that events are synced between the system and third-party calendars like Google, Outlook, or iCloud.\n\n2. **Verify Sync Preferences:** Make sure the sync preferences are set to either Default Sync (One-way Sync) or Two-way Sync as needed. In One-way Sync, events from the system are synced to the linked calendar as blocked slots, while in Two-way Sync, events are synced as appointments, and contacts are created for guests.\n\n3. **Reintegrate Google Connection:** If the Google calendar integration is broken, it might be due to a password change or other reasons causing the refresh token to expire. Reintegrate the Google connection to resolve this issue. This involves reconnecting the Google account to the system to refresh the token and restore syncing capabilities.\n\n4. **Check for Expired Tokens:** If the Google connection has expired, reintegrate the Google account to refresh the token. This is necessary if the access token was revoked due to changes in the Google account, such as a password change.\n\n5. **Ensure Proper Integration:** For group calendars, follow the specific steps to fully reintegrate the Google calendar for team members, ensuring that all appointments and availability are correctly reflected.",

        "answer": "1. **Setting Up the Workflow:** You have set up a workflow using the WhatsApp Delivery Status feature, which allows you to use conditional logic based on the delivery status of WhatsApp messages.\n\n2. **Conditional Logic:** You configured an if/else action to move messages to different pipeline stages based on their delivery status. If the delivery is successful, the message moves to a particular pipeline stage; if not, it moves to another stage.\n\n3. **Issue Identification:** You noticed that not all unsuccessful deliveries were moved to the correct pipeline stage. Upon checking, the execution status indicated that the message was successfully delivered.\n\n4. **Discrepancy in Status:** However, when you checked the message in the conversation menu, it showed that the message delivery was not successful.\n\n5. **Possible Explanation:** This discrepancy might be due to a delay or error in updating the delivery status in the workflow execution compared to the conversation menu.

Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Spam Folder:** Ensure that the emails are not being delivered to the spam folder of the recipients. Sometimes, emails are marked as spam due to various reasons such as content or sender reputation.\n\n2. **Review Error Messages:** If you are using an SMTP provider, check the error messages displayed in the conversation view. These errors are fetched from the SMTP provider and can provide insights into why the email is not being sent. If the error is not clear, consider opening a support ticket with the SMTP provider to get the delivery status of the email. [Document 6]\n\n3. **Mailgun Logs:** If you are using Mailgun, check the Mailgun logs for specific emails. This can help you identify if the email was delivered or if there were any issues. You can filter logs by recipient to get detailed information. [Document 12]\n\n4. **SMTP Configuration:** Ensure that the sender email matches the SMTP email configured. Mismatched emails can lead to delivery issues. [Document 6]\n\n5. **Check for Bounced Addresses:** If an email address has previously bounced, it might be suppressed. Check the suppression list in Mailgun and remove the email if necessary. [Document 12]\n\nBy following these steps, you can identify and resolve issues related to email delivery.",

This integration generates unique Zoom meeting links automatically for each new meeting scheduled, enhancing security and convenience.\n\n2. **Usage Cases**: The integration is beneficial for various scenarios such as team meetings, client consultations, webinars, virtual office hours, online fitness classes, virtual real estate showings, telemedicine appointments, and online cooking classes.\n\n3. **Benefits**: The integration offers automated meeting scheduling, centralized management, multi-user accessibility, calendar syncing, real-time updates, enhanced security, automated notifications, and data tracking.\n\n4. **Integration Prerequisites**: Users need to connect their Zoom account to their profile, and dynamic Zoom links are available only with Round Robin and Collective Calendars.\n\n5. **Integrating the Same Zoom Account with Multiple Users**: Zoom integration is tied to unique User IDs, not email addresses, which can cause issues if a user account is deleted and restored.\n\n6. **Installation Steps**: Users can install Zoom integration via User Profile, Default Meeting Location, or Calendar Settings. Admins can configure Zoom for other users using the \"Login As User\" feature.\n\n7. **Appointment Reminder Workflow**: Users can set up workflows to automate reminders for appointments with dynamic Zoom links included.",

This can be done by checking the error logs or messages in the email service dashboard.\n\n4. **Verify Email Addresses:** Ensure that the email addresses being used are valid and correctly formatted. Invalid addresses can lead to high bounce rates and errors.\n\n5. **Enable Email Validation:** Consider enabling email validation to check the validity of email addresses before sending. This can help reduce the number of failed emails by ensuring that only valid addresses are used.\n\n6. **Review Sending Practices:** Evaluate the current email sending practices to ensure compliance with best practices, such as avoiding sending to large numbers of unverified addresses or using proper authentication methods.\n\n7. **Contact Support:** If the issue persists, contact the email service provider's support team for further assistance and to understand any specific restrictions or limitations that may be in place due to the high error rate.",

        "answer": "To troubleshoot the issue of Mailgun not integrating with a sub-account, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Mailgun Receiving Route:**\n   - Ensure that the Mailgun Receiving Route is set up correctly. Log into Mailgun, go to the Receiving tab, and verify that the webhook matches the required configuration. If there are other webhooks that do not match, try removing them and see if it resolves the issue. If no webhook is present, create a new route with the correct settings.\n\n2. **Verify MX Records:**\n   - Check the MX records for the domain/subdomain associated with the sub-account. Use a tool like Mxtoolbox to verify that the MX records point to `mxa.mailgun.org` and `mxb.mailgun.org` with priority 10. If other records point to different email servers, you may need to set up a subdomain for Mailgun or not use the domain for other email services.\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Domain Configuration:**\n   - Make sure the Mailgun domain is configured for only one sub-account. If the same domain is configured for multiple sub-accounts, it can cause routing issues. Check the Agency View under Settings > Email Services > Location Settings to ensure the domain is mapped correctly.\n\n4. **Reset Mailgun API Key:**\n   - If necessary, reset the Mailgun API key. Go to Agency View > Settings > Email Services > Location Settings, edit the Mailgun API integration for the sub-account, type \"Delete,\" and then re-integrate the API key.\n\nFollowing these steps should help resolve the integration issue with Mailgun for the sub-account.",

        "answer": "1. **DKIM and DMARC Requirement**: Starting February 2024, Gmail and Yahoo will require DKIM and DMARC authentication for emails. It is strongly recommended for all senders to set up DKIM and DMARC.\n\n2. **DMARC Overview**: DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance) is a tool that verifies emails by combining SPF and DKIM methods. It helps prevent email fraud like phishing and allows domain owners to specify how unauthorized use of their email domains should be managed through a policy in the DMARC record.\n\n3. **DMARC Record Setup**: A DMARC record is housed in a TXT-type DNS entry named _dmarc and outlines policies and preferences for email servers. It includes tags such as 'v' for DMARC version, 'p' for policy, 'adkim' for DKIM alignment mode, 'aspf' for SPF alignment mode, and others.\n\n4. **DMARC Policies**: The 'p' tag in a DMARC record specifies the action for emails failing DMARC checks. Options include 'none' (collects feedback without impacting existing flows), 'quarantine' (treats suspicious emails, often directing them to the spam folder), and 'reject' (rejects all failing emails outright).\n\n5. **Resolving DMARC Failures**: If emails are failing DMARC checks, it is advised to temporarily change the DMARC record policy to 'p=none' to ensure message delivery, even if DMARC fails. This change should be temporary.\n\n6. **Example Configurations**: Example configurations for DMARC include setting a quarantine policy with 50% verification for testing (`v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=50;`) and later switching to a reject policy for full enforcement (`v=DMARC1; p=reject;`).",
